<p class="center padb1"><i>FURTHER SOJOURN IN VIENNA. THE JOURNEY
TO MUNICH.</i></p>
<blockquote>
<p class="margin4"><span class="smcap">Frederic Chopin to Elsner.</span></p>

<p class="right"><i>Vienna, January 16th, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Monsieur Elsner</span>,</p>

<p>I much regret that your kindness, of which I
have had so many proofs during my journey, has
once more made me feel ashamed of myself, and
that you have anticipated me with a letter.</p>

<p>I should have felt it my duty to write to you
immediately on my arrival, but I put off doing so
from day to day, feeling almost certain that my
parents would not delay sending you all the news
about me, as I am vain enough to think this would
interest you.</p>

<p>I wanted also to wait till I could tell you something
definite about myself; but since the day on
which I heard of the terrible events in the fatherland,
I have had but one thought&mdash;anxiety and
yearning about my country and my dear ones.</p>

<p>Herr Malfatti has been vainly endeavouring to
persuade me that an artist is, or ought to be, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>cosmopolitan. Supposing this to be so, although I
was an artist in the cradle, I am, as a man, a Pole,
and liable to serve as a soldier, so I hope that you
will not blame me for not having thought seriously
as yet about arranging for a concert.</p>

<p>Obstacles surround me on all sides; not only
has a succession of the most miserable concerts
quite ruined good music, and rendered the public
distrustful, but the recent affairs in Poland have a
prejudicial effect on my position.</p>

<p>I think, however&mdash;and Würfel fully approves my
intention&mdash;of giving my first concert during the
Carnival. The worthy Würfel is a constant sufferer.
I often see him, and find that he has a pleasant
recollection of you.</p>

<p>I should feel little satisfied with my stay here but
for the interesting acquaintances I have made among
the first talent in the place, such names as Slawick,
Merk, Bocklet, &amp;c. The opera is good, and the
Viennese are enchanted with Wildt and Fräulein
Heinefetter; but it is a pity that Duport brings out
so few new operas, and is more careful of his pocket
than of art.</p>

<p>Abbé Stadler<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> is loud in his complaints, and says
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
that Vienna is not what it used to be. He is publishing
his Psalms at Mechettiʼs; I saw the work in
manuscript and admired it.</p>

<p>As to your quartet, Joseph Czerny promised faithfully
that it should be ready on St. Josephʼs day.
He assured me that up till now it had been impossible
for him to put it in hand, as he is just
bringing out Schubertʼs works, many of which are
still in the press. So I am afraid that yours will be
delayed.</p>

<p>As I observed, Czerny is not one of the wealthiest
publishers in this city, and cannot so easily take the
risk of printing a work that is not performed either
at “Sperlʼs” or at the “Römische Kaiser.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DEGENERATION OF PUBLIC TASTE.</span>
Waltzes are here called “works” and Lanner and
Strauss, who play first violin at the performances of
these dances, “capellmeister” (bandmasters.)</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that this is the universal way
of speaking, for there are many who ridicule it;
however, scarcely anything but Waltzes are printed.
It seems to me that Mechetti is of an enterprising
turn of mind, and that he will be more likely to take
your Masses, for he intends to publish the scores of
the famous church composers. I spoke about those
glorious Masses of yours to Mechettiʼs book-keeper&mdash;an
impressible and enlightened Saxon&mdash;he seemed
to think something of them, and, according to what
I hear, he does quite as he likes in the business. I
am invited out to dinner to-day to meet Mechetti.
I shall talk the matter over seriously with him, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>will write to you about it soon. Haslinger is now
publishing Hummelʼs last Mass, for he lives only
for and by Hummel; but it is said that these latest
compositions do not sell well; and Haslinger, who
gave him a large honorarium for them, puts aside
all manuscripts now, and only prints Straussʼs compositions.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was with Nidecki, at Steinkellerʼs,
who has written a libretto for Nidecki. He hopes
for great things from this opera, in which the famous
comedian, Schuster, is to appear. In this case,
Nidecki may make a name for himself. I hope that
this news will please you.</p>

<p>You ask, dear Mons. Elsner, why Nidecki studied
my second concerto? He did so solely by his own
wish. Knowing that he would have to play in public
before his departure from Vienna, and having nothing
suitable of his own, except the beautiful variations,
he asked for my manuscripts. Meanwhile things
have greatly changed; he no longer appears as a
pianoforte <i>virtuoso</i>, but as an orchestral composer.
He will be sure to tell you of it himself. I shall
take care that his overture is performed at my
concert. You will be proud of us yet; at any rate
you shall not be ashamed of us. The pianist, Aloys
Schmitt, has been cut up by the critics, although he
is past forty, and has been composing for eighteen
years.</p>

<p>Kindest remembrances to all the collegians, and
to your own circle. For yourself, I beg you to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>receive the assurance of the unbounded respect with
which I always remain,</p>

<p  class="right padr2">Your grateful and faithful pupil,</p>

<p  class="right">FREDERIC CHOPIN.</p>
<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Vienna, May 14th, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My beloved Parents and Sisters</span>,</p>

<p>I have to go on short commons this week, as
regards letters, but I console myself with the thought
that I shall hear from you again next week, and wait
patiently, trusting that you are as well in the
country as you were in town. As to myself, I am
in excellent spirits, and feel that good health is the
best comforter in misfortune.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">MALFATTI.</span>
Perhaps it is Malfattiʼs soups which have given
me such strength that I really feel better than ever.
If so it is a two-fold regret to me that Malfatti and
his family are gone into the country. You cannot
imagine what a beautiful villa he lives in; I was
there a week ago with Hummel. Having taken us
over his house, he showed us his garden, and when
we were at the top of the hill we had such a splendid
view that we did not want to come down again.
Malfatti has the honour of a visit from the court
every year, and I should not wonder if the Duchess
of Anhalt-Cöthen, who is a neighbour of his, envies
him his garden.</p>

<p>On one side you see Vienna lying at your feet, and
looking as if Schönbrunn were joined to it; on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>other, high hills picturesquely dotted with convents
and villages. This romantic panorama makes you
quite oblivious of the nearness of the noisy, bustling
Kaiserstadt.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was at the Imperial library with
Handler.<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Do you know this is my first inspection
of what is, perhaps, the richest collection of musical
manuscripts in the world? I can scarcely imagine
that the library in Bologna can be larger and more
systematically arranged than this one.</p>

<p>Now, my dearest ones, picture to yourselves my
astonishment at beholding among the new manuscripts
a book entitled “Chopin.”</p>

<p>It was a pretty large volume, elegantly bound; I
thought to myself, I have never heard of any other
musician named Chopin, but there was a certain
Champin, and perhaps there has been a mistake
in the spelling. I took out the manuscript and saw
my own handwriting. Haslinger had sent the
original of my variations to the library. This is
an absurdity worth remembering.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FIREWORKS AND RAIN.</span>
Last Sunday there was to have been a grand display
of fireworks, but the rain spoilt it. It is a
remarkable fact that it almost always rains here
when they are going to have fireworks. This
reminds me of the following story: “A gentleman
had a handsome bronze-coloured coat, but whenever
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
wore it, it rained; so he went to his tailor to
ask him the reason. The tailor was very much
astonished, shook his head, and asked the gentleman
to leave the coat with him for a day or two, as,
possibly, the hat, waistcoat or boots might be the
cause of the misfortune. However, it was not so,
for when the tailor went out for a walk in the coat
the rain suddenly poured down, and the poor man
was obliged to take a cab, for he had forgotten
his umbrella. Some people thought his wife had
taken it to a coffee-party; but, however that may
have been, the coat was wringing wet. After
thinking over this strange occurrence for a long time
it occurred to the tailor that perhaps there was something
strange hidden in the coat. He took out the
sleeves, but found nothing; he undid the tails, then
the front, when, lo and behold! under the lining was
a piece of a hand-bill about some fireworks. This
explained all; he took out the paper, and the coat
never brought down any more rain.” Forgive me
for again having nothing new to tell you about
myself; I shall hope to have some more interesting
news bye and bye. I most sincerely desire to fulfil
your wishes; hitherto, however, I have found it
impossible to give a concert. What do you think
of General Dwernickiʼs victory at Stoczek?</p>

<p>May God continue to fight for us!</p>

<p class="right">Your FREDERIC.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p class="right"><i>Vienna, May 28th 1831.</i></p>

<p>I have just returned from the post, but once more
there is no letter for me! I received one on Wednesday
from Madame Jarocka, with a postscript from
dear Papa, which though very short was very precious
to me. It told me, at least, that you were all
well. As to Marcel and Johann, I beg that they
will not write to me at all, if they are so stingy, that
in spite of my request they can only send a word or
two. I am so angry that I feel as if I could send
back their letters without opening them. Of course
they will make the old excuse of want of time! I
am the only one who has time to write so fully every
week. But how quickly this precious time passes.
It is already the end of May, and I am still in
Vienna, and probably shall be through June, for
Kumelski<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> has been ill and must lay by again.</p>

<p>I can see already that this letter will be a very
wearisome one, but you have no reason to fear that
this is a sign of indisposition. On the contrary, I
am quite well and amusing myself capitally. To-day
I was playing from early in the morning till two
in the afternoon, when I went out to dine and met
the worthy Kandler, who kindly offered to give me
letters to Cherubini and Paër.</p>

<p>I shall visit my invalid in the evening and go
to the theatre, where there is to be a concert at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
which the violinist Herz is to perform. He is an
Israelite, and made his <i>débût</i> at Fräulein Henriette
Sonntagʼs concert in Warsaw, when he was almost
hissed off the stage. The pianist, Döhler, is also to
play some of Czernyʼs compositions, and in conclusion
Herz will give his own variations on Polish
airs. Poor Polish motives, you little think how they
will over-lard you with “Majufes” (Jewish melodies),
giving you the title of “Polish music” to attract the
public.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">POLISH MUSIC AND ITS IMITATIONS.</span>
If you are honest enough to distinguish between
real Polish music and these imitations of it, and to
assign a higher position to the former, you are
thought crazy, more especially as Czerny, who is the
oracle of Vienna, has not, as yet, in the manufacture
of his musical tit-bits, included any variations on a
Polish theme.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon I went with Thalberg to the
Evangelical church, where Hesse, a young organist
from Breslau, was to perform before the most select
of Viennese audiences. The <i>élite</i> of the musical
world were present: Stadler, Kiesewetter, Mosel,
Seyfried, and Gyrowitz. Hesse has talent, and
understands the management of the organ; he left
an album with me, but I donʼt feel as if I had
originality enough to write anything in it.</p>

<p>On Wednesday I was at Beperʼs with Slawick till
2 oʼclock in the morning. He is one of the artists
here with whom I am really on friendly and confidential
terms. He plays like a second Paganini,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>whom, in time, he gives promise of surpassing. I
should not think so, had I not already heard him
several times. I am very sorry that Titus has not
made Slawickʼs acquaintance, for he bewitches his
hearers, and moves them to tears; he even made
Tiger weep; Prince G. and Jskr. were much affected
by his playing.</p>

<p>How are things going on with you? I am
always dreaming of you. Has not the bloodshed
ceased yet? I know what your answer will be:
“Patience.” I constantly console myself with the
same thought.</p>

<p>On Thursday there was a <i>soirée</i> at Fuchsʼs, when
Limmer, one of the best artists here, introduced
some of his own compositions for four violoncellos.
Merk, as usual, made them more beautiful than they
really were by his playing, which is so full of soul.
We stayed there till 12 oʼclock, for Merk enjoyed
playing his Variations with me. He told me so
himself, and it is always a great pleasure for me to
play with him. I think we suit each other very well.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>
He is the only violoncellist I really respect.</p>

<p>I am curious to know how I shall like Norblin;<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>
please do not forget the letter to him.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Vienna, June 25th, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PASSPORT DIFFICULTIES.</span>I am quite well, and that is all that I have to be
happy about, for my departure seems as far off as
ever. I have never been in such a state before.
You know how undecided I am, and then obstacles
meet me at every step. I am promised a passport
every day, and I run from Herod to Pontius Pilate
simply to get back what I gave the police to take
care of. I received a delightful piece of news to-day,
that my passport had been mislaid somewhere
and could not be found, so I must try to procure a
new one. It is strange that every possible misfortune
happens just now to us poor Poles. Although
I am quite ready to start, I cannot.</p>

<p>I have followed Herr Beyers advice and had my
passport <i>viséd</i> for England, although I am only going
to Paris. Malfatti will give me a letter of introduction
to his friend, Paër; Kandler has already mentioned
me in the “<i>Leipziger Musikzeitung</i>.”</p>

<p>I was not home until midnight yesterday, for
it was St. Johnʼs Day, and Malfattiʼs birthday.
Mechetti wished to give him a surprise, and had
engaged Mlles. Emmering and Lutzer, and Messrs.
Wildt, Cicimara, and your Frederic to give a musical
performance in his honour. This almost deserved to
be described as perfect (“parfait.”) I never heard
the Quartet from “Moses” given better; although
Fräulein Gladkowska sang “Oh quante lacrime”
with far more feeling at my farewell concert at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>Warsaw. Wildt was in excellent voice, and I acted
as <i>quasi</i> conductor.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>A considerable crowd was on the terrace of our
house, listening to the concert. The moon shone
marvellously, the fountains rose like columns of
pearls, the air was filled with the perfume of the
orange grove; in short, it was an enchanting night,
the surroundings glorious!</p>

<p>I will now describe the room in which we performed.
Windows, reaching from the ceiling to
the floor, open on to the terrace, from whence
there is a magnificent view over the whole of Vienna.
Large mirrors hung on the walls; but the room was
dimly lighted which heightened the effect of the
moonlight streaming through the windows; and the
roominess of the “cabinet” adjoining the <i>salon</i> on
the left gave to the whole dwelling an air of grandeur.
The open-heartedness and politeness of the host, the
gay and elegant company, the sparkling wit, and the
excellent supper, made it late before we separated.
I live as frugally as possible, and look at every
penny as I did at the ring<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> when I was in Warsaw.
You may as well sell it, for I have cost you enough
already.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>The day before yesterday we were on the Kahlen
and Leopoldsberg with Kumelski; and Czapek, who
visits me every day and gives me most substantial
proofs of his friendship; he offered to lend me money
for travelling, if I wanted it. It was a magnificent
day, and I never took a more beautiful walk. From
the Leopoldsberg you see the whole of Vienna,
Agram, Aspern, Pressburg, and even Kloster-Neuburg,
the castle in which Richard Cœur de Lion
was for some time imprisoned. We had a view
also of all the upper part of the Danube. After
breakfast we went to the Kahlenberg, where King
John Sobieski pitched his camp and sent up the
rockets which were to announce to Count Starhemberg,
Commandant of Vienna, the approach of the
Polish army. There, too, is the monastery of the
Kamedules, where, before the attack of the Turks,
the King knighted his son Jacob, and himself officiated
in the Mass. I have gathered a leaf for
Isabella from the spot which is now covered with
vegetation.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">AN “EASTER-KING.”</span>
From thence we went, in the evening, to the
beautiful valley of Krappenwald, where we saw a
ridiculous boyish frolic, a number of urchins had
covered themselves, from head to foot, with leaves,
and, looking like walking-bushes, crawled from inn to
inn. A boy, covered with leaves, his head adorned
with branches, is called “Easter-king.” This is a
customary jest at Easter-tide.</p>

<p>A few days ago I was at a <i>soirée</i> at Aloys
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>Fuchsʼs.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> He showed me his rich collection of
autograph works (circa 400.) My Rondo<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> for two
pianos was among them. Some of the company
present were desirous of becoming personally acquainted
with me. Fuchs gave me a specimen of
Beethovenʼs handwriting.</p>

<p>Your last letter gave me great pleasure, for I saw
the handwriting of all my nearest and dearest ones
on one piece of paper. Let me kiss your hands and
feet, which are more charming than any to be found
in Vienna.</p>

<hr />

<p class="right"><i>Vienna, Saturday, July 1831.</i></p>

<p>I saw from your last letter, my dearests, that you
have already learnt to bear misfortune with fortitude.
You may be assured that neither am I so readily cast
down. Hope, oh, sweet perennial hope!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE CHOLERA.</span>I have got my passport at last, but have given up
the idea of starting on Monday. We shall go to
Salzburg on Monday and from there to Münich. I
asked for my passport to be <i>viséd</i> for London; and
the police did it at once; but it was kept two days
at the Russian Embassy, and was sent back with
permission to travel to Münich, not to London. It
is all the same to me, if Herr Maison the French
Ambassador will sign it. To these troubles another
has now been added. A certificate of health is
necessary for crossing the Bavarian frontier, on
account of the cholera. We ran about for half a
day with Kumelski, but got the pass in the
afternoon.</p>

<p>We had the pleasure of being at least in good
company during our peregrinations, for Count Alexander
Fredro,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> whom we recognized from his Polish
appearance, his refined manner of speaking, and his
passport, was with us seeking a similar pass for his
servant.</p>

<p>The news to-day is that the town of Wilna is
taken. It is to be hoped this is not true.</p>

<p>Everyone is terribly afraid of the cholera, and the
precautions taken are quite ridiculous. Printed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>prayers are sold, supplicating God and all the saints
to stop the cholera. Nobody ventures to eat fruit,
and most people quit the city.</p>

<p>I leave a Polonaise for the Violoncello with
Mechetti.</p>

<p>Louise writes that Herr Elsner is very pleased
with the review; I am anxious to hear what he will
say about the others, as he was my teacher of composition.
I want nothing but more life and spirit.
I often feel low-spirited, but sometimes as cheerful
as at home. When I feel melancholy I go to
Madame Schaschekʼs, where I generally meet several
amiable young Polish ladies who always cheer me
up with their kind and hopeful words, so that I begin
to mimic the generals here. This is my last new
trick; those who have seen it are ready to die with
laughter. But there are days, alas! when people
do not get two words out of me; then I generally
spend thirty kreuzers in going to Hitzing, or somewhere
else in the neighbourhood of Vienna (for
recreation) to divert my mind. Zacharkiewicz, of
Warsaw, was with me, and when his wife saw me at
Schaschekʼs their astonishment knew no bounds at
my looking such a proper fellow. I have only left
my whiskers on the right cheek, and they grow very
well; there is no occasion to have them on the left,
as you always sit with your right to the public.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">SLEDGING.</span>
The good Würfel was with me the day before
yesterday; Czapek, Kumelski, and several others
also came, and we went together to St. Veit, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
pretty place, which is more than I can say of Tivoli,
where there is a kind of Caroussel, or rather a rail
with sledges, called a “Rutsch.” It is a childish
amusement, but a crowd of grown persons let themselves
roll down the hill in these sledges without the
least object in going. At first I did not at all
care about trying; but as we were eight of us and
all good friends, we began to dare each other to
go down first. It was very foolish, but we all
laughed heartily. I went heart and soul into the
fun till it occurred to me that strong healthy men
might find some better employment at a time like
the present when there is such a universal need for
protection and defence. Confound our frivolity.</p>

<p>A little while ago Rossiniʼs “Siege of Corinth”
was exceedingly well given, and I was very pleased
to have another chance of hearing the opera. Fräulein
Heinefetter, Messrs. Wildt, Binder, and Forti, in a
word, all the best artists in Vienna, were present
and did their utmost. I went to the opera with
Czapek, and when it was over we went to the same
restaurant where Beethoven used to take his supper.</p>

<p>I must say, in case I forget, that I shall probably
take rather more money from Peter the banker than
dear papa had arranged for. I am very economical,
but heaven knows I can only do as I am doing, or I
should set off with an empty purse. God keep me
from illness; but if anything did happen to me, you
might, perhaps, reproach me for not having taken
more. Forgive me, and remember that I have lived
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>on this money during May, June, and July, and that
I have to pay more for my dinner now than in
winter. I am doing this not merely of my own
accord, but on the good advice of others. I am very
sorry to be obliged to ask you. Papa has already
spent more than a penny on me, and I know
how difficult money is to earn. Believe me, my
dearests, it is as hard for me to ask as it is for you
to give. God will help us <i>punctum</i>.</p>

<p>It will be a year in October since I received my
passport; it will need, of course, to be renewed; how
shall I manage it? Write and say if you can send
me a fresh one. Perhaps that is impossible.</p>

<p>I often run out and visit Hans or Titus. Yesterday
I could have sworn I saw the latter in front of
me, but I found it was only a confounded Prussian!</p>

<p>It is to be hoped these expressions will not give
you a bad impression of the manners I have learnt
in Vienna. There is nothing particular about the
style of talk here, except that they say “Gehorsamer
Diener” (your obedient servant) in taking
leave, and pronounce it “Korschamer Diener.” I
have acquired no habit that is truly Viennese; for
instance, I cannot play any waltzes, and that is
proof enough.</p>

<p>God give you health. May no more of our friends
fall. Poor Gustav!</p>

<p>I dine to-day with Schaschek; I shall wear the
studs with the Polish eagles, and use the pocket-handkerchief
with the Kosynier.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>I have written a Polonaise, which I must leave
here with Würfel. I received the portrait of our
commander-in-chief, General Skrzynecki, but frightfully
spoilt, on account of the cholera. Your
letters have also been cut, and each bears a large
sanitary stamp; so great is the anxiety here.</p></blockquote>

<p class="tb"><span class="sidenote">LAST OF CHOPINʼS LETTERS TO HIS FAMILY.</span>
In the last letter, or rather in a few lines, dated
July 20th, 1831, Frederic informs his parents that he
is going to start the same day with Kumelski, for
Münich, through Linz and Salzburg. He writes
that he is well, and provided with money, but fears
that it will not last out, and asks for some more to
be sent to Münich.</p>

<p class="tb">These are all that remain of the large collection of
Chopinʼs letters preserved by his parents. To the
fate which befell the other letters I will refer in the
following chapter.</p>

<p class="center padb1"><i>DESTRUCTION OF CHOPINʼS LETTERS AND OTHER
MEMENTOES IN WARSAW. STAY IN MUNICH.
DEPARTURE FOR PARIS.</i></p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 43px;">
<img src="images/a.jpg" width="43" height="60" alt="ORNAMENT." /></span>FTER
Chopinʼs death, his effects were sold by
auction in Paris, and the furniture of his two
<i>salons</i>, with the souvenirs he had delighted to have
around him, were bought by Miss Stirling, a Scotch
lady, one of his pupils and enthusiastic admirers.
She took them home with her, and they formed a
kind of Chopin Museum. This interesting collection
included a portrait of the gifted artist, painted
by his friend, Ary Schäffer; a grand piano, by
Pleyel, on which Chopin had generally played; a
service of Sèvres porcelain, with the inscription,
“Offert par Louis Philippe à Frédéric Chopin,
1839;” a splendid and costly casket, presented by
Rothschild; and carpets, table-covers, and easy
chairs, worked by Chopinʼs pupils.</p>

<p>Miss Stirling directed, in her will, that when she
died these relics were to be sent to Chopinʼs mother,
to whose house in Warsaw they were accordingly conveyed
in 1858. After the death of Madame Chopin,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
1861, they passed into the hands of her daughter,
Isabella Barcinska. This lady occupied the second
floor of one of two houses standing exactly on the
boundary between the “New World,” and the
“Cracow Suburbs,” and belonging to Count Andreas
Zamoyski.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">UPROAR IN WARSAW.</span>At the commencement of the political disturbances,
which preceded the insurrection of January,
1863, a band of excited young men, inflamed by
opinions which were far from being shared by the
public, conspired to murder all the deputies. Although
the miserable schemes of these fanatical patriots
completely failed, they continued to contrive fresh
ones, till, at length, exasperated beyond endurance
by the bloody conflict which raged through the whole
country, they laid a plot to take the life of Count
von Berg, who, on the recall of Prince Constantine,
had become supreme governor of Poland. Count
Berg was returning in his carriage, on the 19th
September, 1863, at six in the evening, with an
escort of Circassians, from the Belvedère to the
Palace. When the carriage came to the spot where
the “New World” and “Cracow Suburb” adjoin, a
shot, followed by some Orsini bomb-shells, was fired
from a window on the fourth floor of Count Zamoyskʼs
house. The street was immediately in an uproar,
but no one was killed, and only a horse or two
belonging to the escort wounded. A detachment of
the military, who were at that time always kept in
marching order on the Saxon Square, came up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
few minutes. The soldiers surrounded both houses,
rudely dragged out the women, and left them in the
road, while the men were sent, under a military
convoy, to the citadel.</p>

<p>As lava pouring forth from a volcano uproots and
annihilates, with its fiery heat, all objects in its pathway,
so rushed the angry soldiery from room to room,
ruthlessly destroying all that was within their
reach. Furniture, pianos, books, manuscripts; in
short, everything in the house was flung out of
the windows, while wardrobes and other articles too
heavy to move were first cut up with hatchets, and
the legs of pianos sawn off. These two houses were
in the best quarter of the town, and occupied only by
well-to do people. An idea may be formed of the
quantity of furniture they contained from the fact,
that there were from fifteen to twenty pianos.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DESTRUCTION OF CHOPINʼS LETTERS.</span>
When the brutal and insensate soldiery arrived
at the second storey of the house inhabited by
Chopinʼs sister, the mementoes of the great artist,
which the whole family cherished with such pious
care, were doomed to destruction. The piano&mdash;one
of Buchholtzʼs&mdash;on which he had received his
earliest instruction, and which had been the confidant
and interpreter of his first musical ideas, was
flung into the street by these Vandals.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> At night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
soldiers made a stack of the ruined furniture
in the square at the foot of the statue of Copernicus,
and filling their kettles with the wine, spirit, and
sugar from the ransacked shops, they made merry
round the fire, mixing punch and singing boisterous
songs. Pictures, books, and papers&mdash;among the
latter Chopinʼs correspondence with his family
during eighteen years&mdash;were thrown in to feed the
flames. Eye-witnesses relate that an officer, having
lighted upon a portrait of Chopin, painted by a
friend, gazed at it long and earnestly before committing
his wanton deed. The reflection which
illumined the city announced to the terrified inhabitants
that the reign of military terror had begun.</p>

<p>But more to be deplored than the loss of any other
relics, is the destruction of the letters, in which
Chopin had poured forth all his affection for his
family, his love for his country, his enthusiasm for
his art, and his admiration for all that is beautiful
and noble. The letters to his parents from Paris,
written at a period when he was daily gathering
fresh laurels, and was in intimate relations with
the leading artists and the highest personages in
the State, were not only of extreme interest, but
of historical value, as faithful and vivid pictures
of the times. For in these spirited and witty
writings, Chopin often gave, in a word or two, a
more life-like portrayal of his contemporaries than
is to be found in many a long and elaborate description.
The brightest, happiest period of his life, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
real summer-time, was between the years 1832 and
1837; while his sojourn in Vienna, with all its hopes
and dreams, may be called the spring-time of his
existence. But the non-fulfilment of these hopes
depressed the readily despondent spirit of the artist.
The delicacy of his constitution, and the nervous
excitability induced by constant pianoforte playing,
unfortunately deprived him of that energy, of which
no one is more in need than the musician who performs
in public. Chopin succumbed to instead of
fighting against difficulties; he loved peace; but
life&mdash;and to the artist above all&mdash;is a battle.</p>

<p>Being a stranger in Vienna, he was obliged to
depend on the advice of others, and was alternately
suspicious and mistrustful, or confiding as a child.
The disturbances in his country deprived him, as
a Pole, of the protection of the chief dignitaries
of Vienna; while among the artists he met with
indifference, and sometimes envy. Thus, irresolute,
and dispirited, he beheld other pianists gaining
profit and approbation, and himself only took part in
a single matinée given on April 4th, in the large
Redoubt Hall, by the vocalist, Madame Garcia-Vestris.
He gave but one concert,<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> and that not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>until the beginning of June, when, according to
their annual custom, and partly also on account of
the cholera epidemic, the wealthier inhabitants had
left the city; as might be expected the attendance
was small, and the expenses exceeded the receipts.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">LAST CONCERT IN GERMANY.</span>Disappointed in his expectations, Chopin went to
Münich, where he was obliged to stay some weeks,
awaiting money for his journey to Paris. This gave
him an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the
first artists: among others, Bärmann, Berg, Shunke,
and Stunz, who, delighted with his playing and his
works, persuaded him to perform at the Philharmonic
Societyʼs concerts. At one of these Frederic played
his E minor Concerto, with orchestral accompaniments.
Carried away alike by the beauty of the
composition, and the charm and poetry of the
execution, the audience overwhelmed the young
<i>virtuoso</i> with hearty and genuine applause.</p>

<p>This was Chopinʼs swan-song on German soil, for,
during the eighteen years of his residence abroad, he
never again publicly performed in Germany. His
last visit to Vienna seemed to check all his desires
in that direction.</p>

<p>Encouraged by his success in Münich, Chopin left
that hospitable town for Stuttgart, where a heavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>trial awaited him: the news of the capture of
Warsaw by the Russians, September 8th, 1831.
Grief, anxiety, and despair as to the fate of his
family and his beloved one filled up the measure of
his misery. Under the influence of these feelings he
wrote, while still at Stuttgart, the magnificent C
Minor Study, (the last in the first collection, dedicated
to Liszt) frequently called the “Revolutions-Etude.”
Amid the wild storm of rushing passages in the left
hand the melody rises, now passionately, now in
proud majesty, bringing to the mind of the thrilled
listener the image of Zeus hurling his thunderbolts
at the world.</p>

<p>In such a mood Chopin left for Paris at the end
of September, 1831. His passport bore the words,
“passant par Paris à Londres;” and, years after,
when he had become domiciled and naturalised in
France, he often said, with a smile, “I am only
passing through.”</p>

<p>With this concludes the information kindly afforded
me by the Chopin family. I must now have recourse
to my own recollections to Chopinʼs letters,
and to the narrations of trustworthy witnesses who
were in communication with him either by letter
or in person during his residence in the French
capital.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 50px;"><img src="images/w.jpg" width="50" height="59" alt="ORNAMENT." /></span>HEN Chopin came to Paris, it was stirred by a
considerable amount of political agitation;
despite all the efforts of the Legitimists, as the
partisans of Charles X. and his descendants were
called, Louis Philippe, by favour of the barricades,
reigned on the ruins of the Bourbon dynasty. As
we have said, things had not yet quieted down,
and every section of the populace was divided into
parties. Although not advantageous to art, the political
situation was of little consequence to Frederic,
as he had gone to Paris, not for the sake of performing
in public, but solely for self-improvement.</p>

<p>Soon after the taking of Warsaw the Polish army
retired into Prussia and Austria, and many of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
members found their way to Paris, the fugitives
receiving a hearty welcome as they passed through
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> All who, whether in politics or in the
field, had been foremost in the revolution&mdash;the members
of the diet, officers, poets, and writers, who by
patriotic songs or newspaper articles had incited
the people to insurrection&mdash;were in dread of the
vengeance of Russia, and took refuge in France,
hoping that, sooner or later, her sympathy with the
wrongs suffered by Poland would move her to their
redress. Miserable delusion! terrible were its consequences!
Thousands of intelligent men left the
country, carrying with them the light they had shed
on science and art, while their loss, as Russia saw
with satisfaction, was irreparable, for none were
found worthy to take their place. Years of sad
experience were needed to convince the Poles that
their expectations were foolish, their efforts for
freedom useless, and their hopes for aid from France
futile.</p>

<p>Chopin, of course, soon became the centre of the
Polish emigrants in Paris. Assured about the safety
of his relatives in Warsaw, his spirits improved, and
he would often ask himself, “What shall my future
be?” The plans of his tour, which he had formed
at home, having been utterly thwarted, he was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
obliged to start afresh. To give a concert in Paris
did not seem practicable, for who would be likely
to take any interest in a young, unknown pianist,
because he had the effrontery to perform in public?
The few words of praise in the Vienna and Leipsic
papers made no impression in Paris, where the public
were busy with politics and amusements of all kinds.
Besides, the musical world there set little or no store
on <i>critiques</i> in foreign newspapers. Paris, they
thought, was the oracle for the whole civilized
world, and only on the banks of the Seine was
a European reputation to be made or marred.
Frederic was anxious not to let slip the precious
opportunity. He considered himself far from being
a perfect artist, and, therefore, resolved once more
to seek instruction from Kalkbrenner.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">VISIT TO KALKBRENNER.</span>
Frederic Kalkbrenner, then at the height of his
fame as a <i>virtuoso</i>, was regarded as the first pianist
in Europe. Chopin, therefore, paid him a visit, and
expressed his desire of becoming his pupil. Directly
the young Pole began to play, Kalkbrenner perceived
his genius, and that he had nothing more to learn.
Chopin, with his modesty and zeal after the highest
attainments in art, little imagined what was passing
in Kalkbrennerʼs mind. To the latterʼs fame as a
pianist nothing could add, but he might also attain
the reputation of a first-rate teacher, were he to
obtain a pupil of such rare gifts as Chopin. He,
therefore, thought it wise not to refuse to take him.
Kalkbrenner, whose judgment was authoritative, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
who either thought his own opinions infallible or
knew how to proclaim them as such, fancied he
could pick holes in Chopinʼs playing; he declared
that his fingering was quite opposed to the classic
method; that his execution was not that of the best
school; that he was indeed a gifted <i>virtuoso</i> and
composer, but that, although on the right road, he
might easily go astray.</p>

<p>Chopin listened in silence, while M. Kalkbrenner
announced that he was ready to give him lessons,
that he might cure him of those faults which would
always be a hindrance to his progress, but only on
condition that Chopin promised to remain with
him for at least three years. The young artist was
much surprised at such a stipulation, but, not yet
fully conscious of his own worth, he determined to
pause before deciding on a matter of such supreme
importance to him. He, therefore, wrote to his
father, and to Elsner, to ascertain their wishes and
opinions. Elsner was not a little astonished at
Kalkbrennerʼs request, and inquired why such a long
discipline was required for a pianist like Chopin;
did Kalkbrenner desire to undo what was already
done, and to destroy Chopinʼs originality? Elsner
knew better than anyone else what a deep spring of
originality lay hid in the mind of Chopin, and to
what degree his technical powers were developed.
Accordingly he was in favour of cultivating Chopinʼs
“virtuosity,” with a view to his career as a composer,
rather than of hindering the free development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
<span class="sidenote">LETTER FROM ELSNER.</span>of his creative power by a one-sided musical training.
He expressed these opinions in the following letter to
his beloved pupil:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>

<p class="right">“<i>Warsaw, November 27th, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Frederic</span>,</p>

<p>“I was pleased to see, by your letter, that Kalkbrenner,
the first of pianists, as you call him, gave
you such a friendly reception. I knew his father, in
Paris, in 1805; and the son, who was then very
young, had already distinguished himself as a first-rate
<i>virtuoso</i>. I am very glad that he has agreed to
initiate you into the mysteries of art, but it astonishes
me to hear that he requires three years to do so.
Did he think the first time he saw and heard you,
that you needed all that time to accustom yourself to
his method? or that you wished to devote your
musical talents to the piano alone, and to confine
your compositions to that instrument? If he, with
his artistic experience, desires to render service to
our art in general, and to you in particular, and if
he shows himself your sincere friend, then be to him
a grateful pupil.</p>

<p>“In the study of composition, a teacher ought not
to be too narrow-minded and particular, especially
with pupils of decided talent, and who display a
certain independence of invention. They should
rather be allowed to go their own way, and to make
new discoveries. The pupil must not only stand on
the same artistic platform as his master, but, when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>possessing pre-eminent talent, must rise beyond it,
and so cultivate his abilities as to shine by his own
light.</p>

<p>“The playing of any instrument&mdash;be it ever so perfect,
like that of Paganini on the violin, or Kalkbrenner
on the piano&mdash;is, with all its charm, only
the means, not the end of the tone-art. The achievements
of Mozart and Beethoven as pianists have
long been forgotten, and their pianoforte compositions,
although undoubtedly classic works, must
give way to the diversified, artistic treatment of that
instrument by the modern school. But their other
works, not written for one particular instrument, the
operas, symphonies, quartets, &amp;c., will not only continue
to live, but will, perhaps, remain unequalled
by anything in the present day. ‘Sapienti pauca.’</p>

<p>“A pupil should not be kept too long to the study
of one method, or of the taste of one nation. What
is truly beautiful must not be imitated, but <i>felt</i>, and
assimilated with the individual genius. The only
perfect nature is the Divine, and art must not take
one man, or one nation as a model, for these only
afford examples more or less imperfect. In a word,
that quality in an artist, (who continually learns from
what is around him) which excites the wonder of his
contemporaries, can only arrive at perfection by and
through itself. The cause of his fame, whether in
the present or the future, is none other than his
own gifted individuality manifested in his works.</p>

<p>“More bye and bye. Please remember me kindly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>to Count Plater, Grzymala, Hofmann, Lesueur,
Päer, Kalkbrenner, and Norblin. Embrace Orlowski
for me.</p>

<p class="right">JOSEPH ELSNER.”<br /><br /></p>
<hr />
<p><span class="sidenote">LETTER TO ELSNER.</span>To these weighty observations Frederic sent the
following reply:&mdash;</p>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 14th, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Monsieur Elsner</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter gave me a fresh proof of your
fatherly care and sincere interest in me, your grateful
pupil. At the beginning of last year, although
fully conscious of my deficiencies, and of how far I
was from attaining to the model which I had set
before myself in you, I ventured to think that I
could follow in your footsteps, and that I might
produce, if not a Lokietek, perhaps a Laskonogi.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
But now all those hopes have vanished; I have to
think how I can best make my way as a pianist,
and so must, for a time, leave in the back ground
the loftier artistic aims of which you spoke.</p>

<p>To be a great composer, it is not only needful to
possess creative power, but experience and the
capacity for self-examination, which, as you have
taught me, is not acquired by the mere hearing of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>other peopleʼs works, but by a careful criticism of
oneʼs own.</p>

<p>Many young and very talented pupils of the
Parisian Conservatoire are waiting with their hands
in their pockets for the performance of their operas,
symphonies, and cantatas, which hitherto only
Lesueur and Cherubini have seen on paper. I
am not speaking of the smaller theatres, although
these are difficult enough of approach. And when,
like Thos. Nidecki, at the Leopoldstädter Theatre
in Vienna, a composer is fortunate enough to obtain
a performance, he reaps but little benefit from it,
even when, as in this case, the work is a good one.
Meyerbeer, too, after he had been famous in the
musical world for ten years, stayed three years in
Paris waiting, working, and spending money, before
he succeeded in bringing out his “Robert le Diable,”
which has now made such a <i>furore</i>. Auber, with
his very popular works, had forestalled Meyerbeer,
and was not very ready to make room at the Grand
Opera for the foreigner.</p>

<p>In my opinion, the composer who can perform
his works himself is best off.</p>

<p>I have been recognised as a pianist at two or three
cities in Germany; several of the musical papers
gave me commendatory notices, and expressed a
hope that I should soon take a prominent position
among the first pianoforte <i>virtuosi</i>. Now that I have
an opportunity of fulfilling my self-made promise,
should I not embrace it? I did not care to study
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
pianoforte playing in Germany, for no one could tell
me exactly what I was deficient in. Neither did
I see the beam in my own eye. Three years of
study is a great deal too much, as Kalkbrenner
himself perceived when he had heard me two or
three times. From this you can see, dear Mons.
Elsner, that the true <i>virtuoso</i> does not know what
envy is. I could make up my mind to study three
years, if I felt certain that would secure the end
I have in view. One thing is quite clear to my
mind; I will never be a copy of Kalkbrenner; he
<span class="sidenote">RESOLVES TO CREATE A NEW ERA IN ART.</span>
shall not destroy my bold, it may be, but noble
resolution of creating a new era in art. If I take
any more lessons now it will only be that I may
become independent in the future. Ries, when he
had gained a name as a pianist, found it easy to
win laurels in Berlin, Frankfort-on-the-Maine and
Dresden as the composer of “Die Räuberbraut;”
and what a number of years Spohr had been
a famous violinist before he wrote “Faust,”
“Jessonda,” &amp;c.! I trust you will not withhold
your sanction when you see with what aims and
on what principles I am acting.</p>

<p>No doubt my parents have told you that my
concert is fixed for the twenty-fifth of this month.
The preparations have given me a great deal of
trouble, and had not Päer, Kalkbrenner, and
especially Norblin, (who sends kindest regards to
you), taken the matter in hand, I should have been
helpless. Just imagine, it takes at least two months
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>to get up a concert in Paris. Baillot is exceedingly
kind; he offered to play a Quintet of Beethovenʼs
with me, and Kalkbrenner a duet with an accompaniment
of four pianos. Mons. Reicha I only
know by sight, and you can guess how curious
I am to become personally acquainted with him.
Those of his pupils whom I have seen gave me
no very favourable account of him. He does not
like music, and will not talk about it; he never
goes to the Conservatoire concerts, and when he
gives lessons he looks at the clock all the time.
Cherubini acts in a similar fashion, and talks of
nothing but cholera and revolution. These masters
are like mummies, to be respectfully regarded at a
distance, while one draws instruction from their works.</p>

<p>Fétis, whose acquaintance I have made, and from
whom much may be learned, only comes to Paris
to give lessons. It is said that he does so from
necessity, as his debts exceed the profits of the
<i>Revue Musicale</i>. He is in danger sometimes of
seeing the inside of the debtorʼs prison. But, as
in Paris, a debtor can only be legally arrested in
his own house, Fétis has left the city for the
suburbs; Heaven knows where!</p>

<p>There are a host of interesting people here belonging
to the various professions. Three of the orchestras
can be called first-rate: that of the Academy, the
Italian Opera, and the Theâtre Feydeau.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">OPERA IN PARIS.</span>
Rossini is director of the Italian Opera, which is
undoubtedly now the best in Europe. Lablache,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
Rubini, Santini, Pasta, Malibran, and Schröder-Devrient
perform three times a week for the delectation
of the <i>élite</i>. Nourrit, Levasseur, Derivis,
M<sup>me</sup>. Damoreau-Cinti, and M<sup>lle</sup>. Dorus are the stars
of the Grand Opera. Chollet and M<sup>lle</sup>. Casimir
Prévost are much admired at the Comic Opera;
in a word, only in Paris can one learn what singing
really is. I believe that Malibran-Garcia, not Pasta,
is now the greatest songstress in Europe. Prince
Valentin Radziwill is quite captivated by her, and
we often wish you were here, for you would be
charmed with her singing.</p>

<p>Lesueur thanks you for your kind remembrances,
and commissions me to return them a thousand-fold.
He always speaks of you in a friendly way, and asks
every time I see him: “et que fait notre bon Mons.
Elsner? Racontez-moi de ses nouvelles;” and then
speaks of the Requiem you sent him. Everybody
here, from your god-son the young Anton Orlowski
to myself, loves and esteems you. I fear our dear
friend will have to wait some time for the performance
of his opera. The subject is nothing particular
and the theatre is closed till the new year.</p>

<p>The King is not very free with his money, the
artists need a great deal, and the English are the
only people who pay well. I could go on writing till
to-morrow, but will not put your patience to such a
test. Believe me, with all respect and gratitude,</p>

<p class="right padr2">Ever your faithful pupil,</p>
<p class="right">FREDERIC.</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>Not only Elsnerʼs letter, and the advice of friends,
but his own sound understanding made Chopin feel
how superfluous and even ignominious such a course
of lessons would be. He justly perceived that he
must either become a servile copy of Kalkbrenner,
or soon cease to be his pupil; and that as he had
been able to maintain his artistic independence beside
Field and Hummel, he could not do better than give
up Kalkbrennerʼs instruction and take his own way.
To preserve his friendly relations with Kalkbrenner,
and from a genuine feeling of esteem, he dedicated
to him his E minor Concerto. Chopin writes to his
friend Titus Woyciechowski<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> at this time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 6th, 1831.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Titus</span>,</p>

<p>Your letter gave me new life. I receive such
contrary reports, some of which make me very
anxious, for I often put a wrong construction on
what my family write. K. expressed himself so
strangely, that I was frightened at my own thoughts
when I read his words. I trust we may see each
other again in this life. I have been greatly pained
by all that has happened. Who could have foreseen
it?<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Have you forgotten our deliberations the night
before your departure from Vienna? Fate has sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>me hither where I can breathe freely.... But
this is a cause of trouble.</p>

<p>In Paris you find everything. You can amuse
yourself, weary yourself, laugh, weep, and above all,
do what you like, without a soul taking any notice of
you, because thousands are doing likewise. Everybody
goes his own way. I believe there are more
pianists, more <i>virtuosi</i>, and more donkeys in Paris
than anywhere. I came here, as perhaps you have
heard, with very few introductions. Malfatti had
given me a letter to Päer, I received two or three
from the Viennese publishers: and that was all.
When the news of the capture of Warsaw reached
me at Stuttgart, I determined to go to Paris.
Through the bandmaster Päer, I have become
acquainted with Rossini, Cherubini, Baillot, and
Kalkbrenner.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">PLAYS BEFORE KALKBRENNER.</span>
You can imagine how eager I was to hear Herz
and Hiller play; but they are nothing to Kalkbrenner.
To tell the truth, I can play as well as
Herz; I wish I could say as well as Kalkbrenner,
who is perfection in quite another style to Paganini.
Kalkbrennerʼs fascinating touch, the quietness and
equality of his playing, are indescribable; every note
proclaims the master. He is truly a giant, who
dwarfs all other artists. When I presented myself
to Kalkbrenner he asked me to play something.
What could I do? However, having heard Herz, I
plucked up my courage, and played my E minor
Concerto, which took so immensely in the Bavarian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>capital. Kalkbrenner was astonished, and asked if
I were a pupil of Field. He remarked that I had
Cramerʼs style, but Fieldʼs touch. I was very much
amused by Kalkbrenner, who, in playing to me,
made a mistake which brought him to a stand-still;
but the way in which he recovered himself was
marvellous. Since this meeting we have seen each
other every day; either he comes to me, or I go to
him. He offered to take me as a pupil for three
years, and to make a great artist of me. I replied
that I knew very well what were my deficiencies;
but I did not wish to imitate him, and that three
years were too much for me. He has persuaded me
that I only play well when I feel inspired. The
same cannot be said of him, for he plays one time
just like another. After watching me for some time,
he said that I belonged to no school, that although I
was undoubtedly progressing very well, I might
easily go astray, and that when he left off playing
there would be no representative of the great pianoforte
school. Further, that however much I might
have the will, I could never create a new school, for
I was not acquainted with the old ones. But I am
certain that there is an individuality about my compositions,
and I shall always strive to go forward.</p>

<p>If you were here I know you would say: “learn,
young man, as long as you are told to.” But many
friends advise me not to take lessons; they think that
I play as well as Kalkbrenner, and that he only
wants to have me as a pupil out of vanity. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>is absurd. Anybody who understands music must
appreciate Kalkbrennerʼs talents, although he is personally
unpopular, as he will not associate with
everybody. But I can assure you there is something
superior about him, as about all the <i>virtuosi</i> whom I
have hitherto heard. I told my parents so, and they
quite understood it, but Elsner did not; he considered
that Kalkbrenner found fault with my playing
out of jealousy. Nevertheless, I have already made
a name among the artists here.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FIRST CONCERT IN PARIS.</span>I am going to give a concert on the 25th of
December, with the assistance of Baillot, Paganiniʼs
rival, and Brod, the celebrated hautbois player. I
am going to play my F minor Concerto, and the
variations in B major. Of the latter, I received
from Cassel, a few days ago, a review, ten pages long,
by an enthusiastic German, who, after an exhaustive
preface, analyzed every bar. He does not consider
them variations according to the orthodox style, but
a picture of the imagination. He says of the second
variation that Don Juan and Leporello are running;
of the third that he is fondling Zerline to the disgust
of Masetto. In the D flat major in the fifth bar of
the Adagio he can perceive Don Juan kissing Zerline.
A comical conceit of the reviewerʼs, who is very
anxious that the composition should be printed in
the <i>Revue Musicale</i> (a paper belonging to his son-in-law
Fétis.)</p>

<p>The good Hiller, a very talented young man, and a
pupil of Hummel, gave a concert the day before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>yesterday, which produced a great effect. One of
his own symphonies was received with loud applause.
He has made Beethoven his model, and his work is
full of poetry and enthusiasm. He was sufficiently
interested in me to tell Fétisʼs father-in-law that he
would do me more harm than good by that notice of
his. But to return to my concert: I am not only to
play the F minor Concerto and the variations, but
perform, with Kalkbrenner, his duet, “Marche
suivie dʼune Polonaise,” for two pianos, with accompaniments
for four pianos. Is not that a wild
idea? One of the pianos is very large and is for
Kalkbrenner, another very small one (a so-called
monochord) is intended for me. On the other large
ones, which make as much noise as an orchestra,
Hiller, Osborne, Stamaty, and Sowinski are to play.
Norblin, Vidal, and the famous viola player, Urhan,
will also assist. The most difficult matter of all
was to find a vocalist. Rossini would willingly have
helped me to obtain one if he had been allowed to,
but Robert, the second director of the Italian Opera,
objected. He declared that if it were known he
had obliged me he should be besieged by hundreds of
similar applications.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">OPERATIC SINGERS IN PARIS.</span>
As to the opera, I must say I never heard such a
fine performance as last week, when the “Barbiere”
was given, with Lablache, Rubini, and Malibran-Garcia.
There was, too, an excellent rendering of
“Otello,” with Rubini, Lablache, and Pasta; also
the “Italiana Algeri.” Paris has, in this respect,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
never offered so many attractions as now. You can
have no idea of Lablache. They say that Pastaʼs
voice has rather gone off, but I never in my life
heard such heavenly singing as hers. Malibranʼs
wonderful voice has a compass of three octaves, and
she is in her style unique and fascinating. Rubini,
a capital tenor, makes no end of <i>roulades</i>, and often
too many <i>coloratures</i>, but by his incessant recourse to
the trill and <i>tremolo</i>, he wins enormous applause.
His mezza-voce is incomparable. A certain Schröder-Devrient
has just come out, but she does not make
such a <i>furore</i> here as in Germany. Signora Malibran
gave “Otello;” Schröder-Devrient, Desdemona.
Malibran is a much smaller woman than the German
singer, and people thought, several times, that Desdemona
would strangle Othello. This was a very
expensive performance. I paid twenty-four francs
for my place, just to see Malibran as the Moor, and
not a very extraordinary impersonation either. The
orchestra was first-rate, but the appointments of the
Italian Opera are nothing to those of “LʼAcadémie
Royale.”</p>

<p>I do not believe that any spectacle at the Italian
Opera, however brilliant, ever came up to that of
“Robert le Diable,” the new five-act opera of Meyerbeer,
the author of the “Crociato.” “Robert” is a
master-piece of the new school, in which devils sing
through speaking trumpets, and the dead rise from
their tombs, but not as in “Szarlatan,”<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> only fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>or sixty at once. The stage represents the interior
of a ruined cloister, with the moonlight falling
brightly on the nuns lying in their graves. In the
last act monks appear with incense amid a gorgeous
illumination, and the solemn strains of the organ resound
from the adjacent building. Meyerbeer has, by
this work, made himself immortal; yet it took him
more than three years to obtain a performance of it.
It is said that for the organ and other accessories he
paid more than twenty thousand francs.</p>

<p>Madame Damoreau-Cinti is also a very fine singer;
I prefer her to Malibran. The latter astonishes, but
Cinti fascinates you. She sings the chromatic scales
and <i>coloratures</i> almost more perfectly than the famous
flautist, Tulou, plays them. It would be almost
impossible to find a more perfect <i>technique</i>. Nourrit,
the first tenor at the Grand Opera, is admired for his
warmth of feeling. Chollet, the first tenor of the
Opera Comique, the best impersonator of Fra Diavolo
and excellent in the operas “Zampa” and “Fiancée,”
has quite an original manner of conceiving a part.
He charms universally by his sympathetic voice, and
is the darling of the public. The “Marquise de
Brinvilliers” is now being played at the Opera
Comique; this marquise was the most famous
poisoner in the time of Louis XIV. The music is
by eight composers: Cherubini, Päer, Herold, Auber,
Berton, Batton, Blangini, and Caraffa.</p>

<p>I pray, above all, dear Titus, that you will write
to me soon, or come yourself. My address is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>Boulevard Poissonnière, 27. W. W. expects you. I
should be so delighted to see you, and there are
times when I am almost mad with longing, especially
when it rains, and I cannot go out. I shall, I think,
have the assistance of the best artists at my concert.</p>

<p class="right padr2">Yours till death,</p>

<p class="right">FREDERIC.<br /><br /></p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="sidenote">PARIS MORE PLEASANT THAN PROFITABLE.</span>We see from this letter that Chopin was delighted
with Paris. He found himself highly esteemed by
the most celebrated artists, yet much still remained
for him to desire. He had come to Paris with very
modest means, and with neither fame nor patronage,
but he did not wish to be always dependent on the
kindness of his father, who was far from rich, and
had daughters to care for. Much, too, as Frederic
liked France, especially Paris, he felt that he was
in a foreign country, and that the Poles with whom
he associated were fugitives. It gave him pain
to hear his native land mentioned. Under
these circumstances, he curtailed his expenditure
as much as possible, and shared his lodgings with
needy friends.</p>

<p>He had hoped that his concert would make him
a name among the musical public, but as the
theatrical director, Véron, would not permit any
of his singers to assist, the performance was of
necessity postponed till February 26th, 1832. Unfortunately,
however, the receipts did not even clear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
the expenses, for only the well-to-do among the
Polish refugees attended, and there was scarcely
a French person present. Chopinʼs friends tried
to console him by telling him of the difficulties other
artists had had to struggle against in their early days.
His true friends&mdash;and he had indeed some such&mdash;advised
him to go more into society, for which he
had plenty of opportunity, but on this point he
was not to be persuaded. The letters to his parents
at this period are tinged with melancholy.</p>

<p>His stay in Paris was saddened by the absence
of any prospect of improving his position. He,
therefore, turned his thoughts to quite another plan
of life. Some young Polish exiles, who were neither
able nor willing to remain in Paris, had resolved
to go to America. Chopin, knowing there was a
lack of good artists in the New World, thought
that he should do well to go there, and so be
no longer a burden to his father. He knew
full well that his parents expected his entire confidence,
so he communicated his intentions, endeavouring
to persuade them that he could do nothing
better than leave France, and seek his fortunes on
the other side of the Western ocean.</p>

<p>One involuntarily asks: what part could be played
by Chopin, with his romantic and poetical nature,
in a country where coolness and practical ability are
of paramount importance? With his life-long horror
of charlatanism, his refined taste and aristocratic
tendencies, how could he have lived in America,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
or how could the Americans have appreciated him?
Had he settled there merely as a teacher, he would,
perhaps, have grown rich; but he would never have
shone among the stars of the musical world.</p>

<p>Fortunately for Chopin his parents were thoroughly
opposed to his emigrating. They conjured him to
stay in Paris and wait for brighter days, or to return
to Warsaw. Rather than consent to his going to
America, they would endure to see their son exposed
to the disagreeable consequences imposed by the
Russian Government on every one who remained
abroad after his passport had expired. His love
for his country, his family, and one whose image
was deeply seated in his heart, awakened an ardent
longing to return home, although it was not easy
for him to leave Paris with its manifold attractions.
His friends and fellow-artists, Franz Liszt, Hiller,
and Sowinski, tried to dissuade him from leaving
Paris, but Chopin would not listen to them.</p>

<p>His meeting with Prince Valentine Radziwill in
the street on the very day that Chopin was preparing
for his departure, may appear to many persons as
mere chance, but it was not unlike a Providential
arrangement. The Prince was very friendly, and
Chopin divulged his intention, and bade him farewell.
Instead of venturing to dissuade him from
his purpose, the Prince exacted a promise that he
would spend the evening with him at Rothschildʼs.
In after life the importance of that evening often
recurred to Chopin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A PECUNIARY TURNING-POINT.</span>In the brilliant <i>salons</i> of the financial king, the
artist, whose every hope had fled, met the <i>haute
volée</i> of Paris. The hostess asked him, in a kind
manner, to play something, and he played and
improvised as he had, perhaps, never done before.
His audience was enraptured; they vied with each
other in expressing their respect and admiration, and
were unwearied in praising his talents. From that
evening his position changed as if by magic; the
future once more smiled upon him, the mists which
had hidden the sunshine of his life disappeared
before the bright rays of his rising fortunes.
Even during the <i>soirée</i> Chopin received several
requests to give lessons from the first families in
Paris. His pecuniary affairs improved daily. There
was no further occasion for him to take anything
from his parents, and he entirely gave up the idea
of returning to Warsaw.</p>

<p class="center"><i>IMPROVEMENT OF CHOPINʼS POSITION IN PARIS.
ELSNERʼS LETTER. MOSCHELESʼS AND FIELDʼS
OPINIONS OF CHOPIN. TRIP TO AIX-LA-CHAPELLE,
CARLSBAD, MARIENBAD, DRESDEN, AND LEIPSIC.
VISIT TO MENDELSSOHN AND SCHUMANN.</i></p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 32px;"><img src="images/c.jpg" width="32" height="60" alt="ORNAMENT." /></span>OINCIDENT with the rise of Chopinʼs star
above the horizon of Parisian society was the
spread of his fame as a composer, so that after 1832
his works, some of which he had written in his own
country, some in Vienna, Leipsic, Paris, or during
his travels, became widely diffused. They included
the three Nocturnes, op. 15; Bolero, op. 19;
Scherzo, op. 20; Grande Polonaise Brillante, op.
22; Ballade, op, 23; four Mazurkas, op. 24; two
Polonaises, op. 26; two Nocturnes, op. 27; and
Impromptu, op. 29.</p>

<p>By most of the professional critics, these were, as
we have already said, dogmatically condemned as
being devoid of all artistic merit. There were,
however, some few&mdash;but very few indeed&mdash;who unreservedly
recognized the boldness and originality of
thought, the rare wealth of harmony, and the newness
of form displayed in Chopinʼs compositions, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
who were not staggered by the novelty of a fingering,
totally opposed to the traditional method.
Field and Moscheles, however, could not forgive
Chopinʼs frequent departures from the customary
and classical forms, nor could they regard him as
other than a bold revolutionist. In 1833 Moscheles
wrote on Chopinʼs early works as follows:<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I gladly avail myself of a few leisure evening hours
to become acquainted with Chopinʼs Etudes and other
works. Their originality and the national colouring of
the motives are very charming; but my fingers are
constantly stumbling over hard, inartistic, and to me
incomprehensible modulations, so that the whole often
seems too cloying, and unworthy of a man and an accomplished
musician.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on he writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I am a sincere admirer of Chopinʼs originality; he
produces the newest and most attractive pianoforte work.
But personally, I object to his artificial and often forced
modulations; my fingers stick and stumble at such
passages, and practise them as I may, I never play them
fluently.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Although he somewhat modified this opinion in
after years, it is indicative of the impression produced
on the most celebrated pianists by Chopinʼs
early works. Field had a presentiment that his own
glory would be dimmed by the rise of this new and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>brilliant orb, and he publicly spoke of Chopin as,
“un talent de chambre de malade.” This criticism,
which principally found credence in Germany, was
for ever silenced by the pen of Eusebius and
Florestan, in Robert Schumannʼs <i>Neue Zeitschrift
für Musik</i>.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS GREAT POPULARITY.</span>The fame and popularity of Chopin in the Paris
<i>salons</i> increased with marvellous rapidity. He was
overwhelmed with requests to play at public concerts,
for it was well-known how attractive he was to
cultivated audiences. On May 20th, 1832, he played
at a concert in the hall of the Conservatoire, got up
by the Prince of the Muscovites for the benefit of the
poor. He chose the first Allegro from his F minor
Concerto with orchestral accompaniments,<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Girard
directing. Heinrich Herz asked Chopin and Liszt
to take part with him in a quartet for eight hands on
two pianos, at a concert he wished to give with his
brother Jacob, on April 3rd, 1833. Orlowski, a
fellow student of Chopinʼs, wrote to his own family
about that time:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Chopin is healthy and strong; he turns the heads of
all the ladies, and the men are jealous of him. He is
now the <i>mode</i>, and the fashionable world will soon be
wearing gloves à la Chopin. But he pines after his
country.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span></p>
<p>Johannes Matuszynski, who came to Paris in the
same year (1834) to study medicine, says the same
thing in a letter to his father-in-law, in Warsaw:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The first thing I did, on arriving in Paris, was to
find out Chopin, and I cannot describe what a pleasure
it was to us both to meet again after an absence of five
years. He has grown so strong and big that I scarcely
knew him again. Chopin is the first pianist in Paris,
and gives a great many lessons, but none under twenty
francs. He has composed a great deal, and his works
are very much sought after. I am living with him in
the Rue Chaussée dʼAntin, No. 5. This street is indeed
rather far from the School of Medicine and the hospitals;
but I have good reasons for wishing to be with him; he
is all in all to me. We spend the evening at the theatre
or in visiting, and if we do neither of these we make ourselves
comfortable at home.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">ELSNER URGES HIM TO WRITE AN OPERA.</span>
Eisner followed from a distance the artistic development
of his beloved pupil, with the warmest
interest, and rejoiced over his success. He wrote to
him as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">
<i>Warsaw, September 14th, 1834.</i>
</p>

<p>Everything that I hear and read about my dear
Frederic gives me pleasure, but pardon my candour
when I say that I have not yet heard enough to satisfy
me, whose pleasure it was, unworthy as I am, to be
your teacher in harmony and counterpoint, and who will
ever be one of your best friends and admirers. Before I
leave <i>hac lacrimarum valle</i> I should like to see a performance
of your operas, not only for the sake of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
increasing your fame, but in the interests of musical art
generally, especially if the subject were taken from the
history of Poland. I am not saying too much. You
know that I cannot flatter you, as I am acquainted not
only with your genius but with your capacities, and I
know that what the critic referred to in your Mazurkas
will only become valuable and lasting in an opera.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Urban says, “that a pianoforte composition stands in
the same relation to a vocal, orchestral, or a composition
for any other instrument, as an engraving does to
an oil painting.” This is sound criticism, although
some compositions (especially when you play them)
may be regarded as coloured plates.</p>

<p>What a pity it is that we can no longer see and talk
to each other; I have a great deal more that I could
tell you. And I want also to thank you for the present,
which is doubly valuable to me. I wish I were a bird
that I might visit you in your Olympian abode, which
the Parisians consider a swallowʼs nest.</p>

<p>Farewell; love me as I love you, for I am now and
ever</p>

<p class="right padr3">Your sincere friend and well-wisher,</p>

<p class="right padb1">JOSEPH ELSNER.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>
<p>Elsnerʼs letter made Chopin think seriously about
composing an opera, and he asked his friend Stanislas
Kozmian to write a libretto on a subject from Polish
history. Unfortunately, however, either from want
of time, or because he feared the Russian Government
might object to a Polish national opera,
Frederic soon relinquished the idea. Perhaps also
the approbation and popularity which his pianoforte
works met with everywhere, and especially in
Paris, induced him to adhere to that kind of composition.
In February 1834, he gave his second
public concert in Paris. It took place at the Italian
opera-house, and was the most brilliant performance
of the season. Habeneck conducted, and the Concerto
in E minor was performed for the first time.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to promise the most satisfactory
results for the <i>bénéficiaire</i>. The hall was filled
with the best of the Parisian aristocracy, with whom
Chopin was the first favourite, and the presence of
the foremost artists gave an especial interest to the
event. But Fredericʼs hopes were disappointed. His
refined and poetical playing could not be heard to
advantage in the large theatre; and it failed to
arouse the enthusiasm of the audience. Chopin felt
this, and for a long time was unwilling to play again
in a large public hall. The <i>salon</i> and a select circle
of poets, artists, and connoisseurs formed a more
fitting arena for the triumphs of the gifted and
keenly sensitive artist.</p>

<p>Like those rare and beautiful plants which can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
only flourish in a soft genial climate, Frederic, with
his exquisite culture and delicate sensibilities, could
only play <i>con amore</i> when in the best society, and
among connoisseurs who knew how to appreciate
all the niceties of his performance, which under such
conditions had a truly magical charm. It was not
in Chopinʼs nature to win the favour of the general
public; and we might say of him, in Goetheʼs words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Wer den Besten seiner Zeit genug gethan,</div>
<div class="line">Der hat gelebt fur alle Zeiten!”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="sidenote">DISLIKE TO GIVING CONCERTS.</span>
With the exception of a journey to Rouen, to
take part in his friend Orlowskiʼs concert, which
was a great sacrifice in the cause of friendship, as
appearing in public was distasteful to him, Frederic
made no more artistic tours after he settled in Paris.
He said in confidence to Liszt: “I am not adapted
for giving concerts: I feel timid in the presence
of the public; their breath stifles me, their curious
gaze paralyzes me; but with you it is a vocation, for
if you do not please the public you know how to
agitate and confound them.”</p>

<p>But in the midst of a circle of beautiful women,
surrounded by friendly and familiar faces, a new
poetical life stirred within him; the look of melancholy,
which so often overshadowed his face, yielded
to an amiable and sympathetic smile; the earnest
and beautiful expression of his features was wonderfully
fascinating; his conversation sparkled with
intelligence, and, unconsciously to himself, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
influence of his fresh and harmless wit was indescribably
felt by those around. When in a happy
mood, his improvisation delighted and elevated the
minds of his hearers, or if he happened to be under
the inspiration of Comus,<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> awakened a sense of the
purest and most innocent joy. He was often in
those moods in French, but more often in Polish
households, in which, of course, he felt more at
home, and, although in the midst of Paris, could
fancy himself once more in his beloved fatherland.</p>

<p>He liked to have all the new <i>belles lettres</i> publications
sent to him. To any poem that took his fancy
he would write a melody, which was soon spread
abroad by his friends Fontana and Orda. (The
latter, a youth of great promise, fell in Algiers).
Prince Casimir Lubomirski, Grzymala, and other
musical Poles took an interest in these improvisations,
and helped to make them known. These
songs were often heard at the houses of Countess
Komar, and her charming daughters&mdash;one of whom
was Princess Beauvau&mdash;where Chopin was always
a welcome guest. The clever Princess and her
younger sister, the Countess Delphine Potocka,
famous for her rare beauty and her fascinating
singing, gathered around them the <i>élite</i> of the literary
and artistic world. No wonder was it that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
young Countess made a profound and striking impression
on the susceptible heart of Frederic, and
that it was a delight to him to accompany her
magnificent voice with his poetical playing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">MEETS MENDELSSOHN AT AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</span>
In the latter half of May, 1834, Chopin determined,
for the first time, to forsake his pupils and take
a trip to Aix-la-Chapelle, with Ferdinand Hiller, in
order to be present at the grand Lower-Rhine musical
festival, conducted by Mendelssohn. Chopinʼs
friendship with the celebrated composer of “St.
Paul” dated from their meeting in Paris, in 1832,
and resting as it did on mutual regard, was now
confirmed and strengthened. Mendelssohn, who
was at that time director of the Düsseldorf Stadt
Orchestra, was much pleased to meet, at Aix-la-Chapelle,
his old friend Hiller, and also Chopin,
whose compositions he esteemed very highly.
During the festival he spent as much time as
possible with the two Parisians, about whom he
wrote, on May 23rd, to his mother:&mdash;</p>

<p>“They have both made progress in their playing, and
Chopin is now one of the first pianists; he produces as
many novelties on the piano as Paganini does on his
violin, and marvels that one would not have thought possible.
Hiller, too, is an excellent player, with plenty of
force and fancy. But both of them aim rather at Parisian
sensationalism, and too often disregard time, repose, and
true musical feeling. I, perhaps, incline to the opposite
extreme, and so we supplied each otherʼs deficiencies,
and all three, I believe, learnt something from one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>another. About me there was a dash of the school-master,
about them the <i>soupçon</i> of a <i>mirliflore</i> or an
<i>incroyable</i>. After the festival we travelled together to
Düsseldorf, and spent a very pleasant day in music and
discussion; yesterday, I accompanied them to Cologne;
and early this morning they went up by steamer to
Coblentz, and I came down. Thus ended the charming
episode.”<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>A great pleasure was in prospect for Chopin in the
following year. His father had been strongly urged
by the Warsaw doctors to go to Carlsbad for the
sake of his health, and as soon as Frederic heard
that this was decided on he left Paris, about the end
of July, and in a few days had the pleasure of
embracing his beloved parents, whom, for five
years, he had so painfully missed. It is more
easy to imagine than to describe the delight of this
meeting. Their dear little Frederic had become a
man, and had grown stronger and more staid.
He had acquired a certain dignity of bearing, which
well became him, and which commanded the respect
of the artistic world; but in affection and gratitude
to his parents he was the same Fritz, who in childhood
and youth had delighted the hearts of his
father and mother. The time sped very enjoyably,
and the sad and trying parting hour came a great
deal too soon for Frederic no less than for his
affectionate father and tender mother. Again and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
again they clasped their beloved son in their arms,
vainly endeavouring to banish the presentiment that
they would never see him again in this world. And
this was the last time that these good parents,
whose constant care was for the welfare of their son,
ever beheld him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">SHORT VISIT TO LEIPSIC.</span>
Frederic spent a few days at Leipsic on his return
to Paris. His arrival had been expected, and of
course there was a great excitement in artistic
circles about the playing of so original and poetic
a composer. The conflicting opinions about his
works added to the interest of his visit. A letter
from Frederic Wieck, father of the famous Clara,
to Nauenburg, a music teacher at Halle, shows
what a sensation the coming of Chopin created
among the musicians of Leipsic.<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> It runs as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dearest Friend</span>,</p>

<p>“I hasten to answer your letter of the 19th, which I
received last evening. Banck returns to-morrow, so
then we shall be altogether. Now for the musical news.
The first subscription concert, under the direction of
Mendelssohn, will take place on October 4th, the second
on the 11th. To-morrow, or the next day, Chopin will
arrive from Dresden, but probably he will not give a
concert, for he is very lazy. He might have remained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>longer here, had he not been dissuaded by a false friend
(a dog of a Pole) from making the acquaintance of the
musical world of Leipsic; Mendelssohn, however, who
is very friendly with Schumann and myself, will perform.
According to a speech which Chopin made to a
friend in Dresden he does not believe there is a lady in
Germany who can play his compositions. We will see
what Clara can do.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There seems to me no justification for the ill-humour
of the much-esteemed musical pedagogue,
who is so uncomplimentary in his expressions and
so hasty about the imaginary false friend. Chopin
had not thought of giving a concert in Leipsic, as he
was only passing through, and he had, moreover, a
great dislike to performing in public. He was very
pleased with the Leipsic artists, and played some of
his own compositions to them at Mendelssohnʼs
house; he also heard Clara Wieck, and was delighted
with her poetical playing, and, astonished at the
marvellous attainments of one so young, for whom
he prophesied a brilliant future.</p>

<p>It is quite possible that Chopin may have doubted
whether there was a lady in Germany capable of
playing his compositions; but it is very unlikely
that he should have said so, for he was always very
gallant to ladies, and was, as we know, a sincere
admirer of Fräulein Blahetkaʼs playing.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">LETTER FROM MENDELSSOHN TO HIS SISTER.</span>In a letter from Mendelssohn to his sister Fanny
Henselt, we find the following:&mdash;<br /><br /></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right">
<i>Leipsic, Oct. 6th, 1835.</i>
</p>

<p>.... The day after I left Henseltʼs for Delitzsch
Chopin arrived there; he could only stay a day, so
we spent the whole of it together and had music. I
cannot help saying, dear Fanny, that I have recently
discovered that your criticism did not do him justice;
perhaps, as is often the case, he was not in the right
humour when you heard him. I have once more been
charmed by his playing, and I am convinced that if you
and father had heard him perform some of his best
compositions as he played them to me, you would say
the same thing.</p>

<p>There is something so thoroughly original and
masterly about his pianoforte playing, that he may be
called a truly perfect <i>virtuoso</i>; and as I love perfection
in any form, I spent a most agreeable, although a very
different day from that with you at Henseltʼs. I was
very glad to be once more with a thorough musician, not
with those half <i>virtuosi</i> and half classists, who would
like to unite in music “les honneurs de la vertu et les
plaisirs du vice,” but with one who has a clearly defined
aim, and although this may be the poles asunder from
mine, I can get on with such a person capitally, but
not with those half-and-half people. Sunday evening
was really very remarkable when Chopin made me play
over my oratorio to him, while curious Leipzigers stole
into the room to see him, and when, between the first
and second parts, he dashed into his new <i>études</i> and
a new Concerto, to the amazement of the Leipzigers;
and then I resumed my “St. Paul.” It was just as
if a Cherokee and a Kaffir had met to converse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<p>He also played a sweetly pretty new nocturne, a good
deal of which I have got by heart that I may please
Paul by playing it to him. Thus we had a good time of
it together, and he promised faithfully to return in the
winter if I would compose a new symphony and give a
performance of it in his honour; we pledged ourselves,
in the presence of three witnesses, so we shall see
whether we both keep our word.</p></blockquote>

<p>This letter shows that Mendelssohn had no
great antipathy to Chopinʼs compositions, and
that he was much interested by many of them;
Mademoiselle Ehlert, the authoress of “Musical
Letters to a Friend,” is, therefore, wrong in placing
Mendelssohn among Chopinʼs opponents. It has
been said that Mendelssohn would not allow his
pupils to play Chopinʼs compositions. As far as
I know, the composer of “St. Paul” and “Elijah”
had no time to give lessons, and it is quite understandable
that he may not have recommended
Chopinʼs works to the pupils of the Leipsic Conservatoire.
But, with his love of justice, Mendelssohn
felt it his duty to combat the objections of his
sister, who had been educated on the old classic
principles.</p>

<p>Chopinʼs second and last sojourn in Germany was
in 1836. Under the pretext of trying a cure he went
to Marienbad, and there his destiny was decided.
Every flame, however fierce, must expire unless it
receive nourishment. Constantia Gladkowska, whom
the youthful Frederic had worshipped as a saint,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
married in Warsaw. When Chopin heard the news
he was deeply grieved and even angry. But time,
which heals all wounds, calmed his passionate spirit,</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">BETROTHED TO MARIA WODZYNSKI.</span>Chopin met in Paris some young Poles of good
family&mdash;the brothers Wodzynski, who had been at
his fatherʼs <i>pension</i>. Through them he became
acquainted with their sister Maria, a charming and
amiable girl. He felt attracted towards her at first
sight, and his interest gradually changed to ardent
love. Knowing that in the middle of July she would
be with her mother at Marienbad he went thither,
full of hope and longing. Chopin soon discovered that
Maria returned his affection, and they were engaged
with the glad consent of their relatives. When they
left Marienbad the Wodzynski family decided to
spend a few weeks with Chopin at Dresden.</p>

<p>Frederic felt at this time at the topmost pinnacle
of happiness, and his gay humour communicated
itself to everyone around him. His friends, remembering
the harmless but clever jokes he used to play
in his youth during his visits to the country, rejoiced
that the famous artist, the darling of Parisian drawing
rooms, had so preserved his natural simplicity
and loveable modesty. They would laughingly
recall how often he used to take his sistersʼ delicate
evening gloves when he could not afford to buy new
ones for himself, and how he promised to send them
gloves from Paris by the dozen; a promise which, as
soon as he had made a position in that city, he
conscientiously performed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>He would often mimic the playing of the most
celebrated European <i>virtuosi</i>, imitating them even in
the minutest details. He frequently played his
mazurkas, which are full of a sweet melancholy,
and then show how the rhythm must be shortened
to adapt them for dancing. Directly the conversation
turned upon his own family he grew serious;
he was no longer the artist indulging his own wayward
fancies, but the grateful son and affectionate
brother. From infancy till death he had constantly
received proofs of the tenderest affection, and his
glowing and sensitive heart was bound to his parents
and sisters by innumerable and indissoluble ties; he
therefore suffered more from absence than many
another.</p>

<p>When full of the hope of becoming a happy bridegroom,
he formed a plan for leaving Paris, his
second home, with all its fascinating charms, its
glittering <i>salons</i>, the scene of so many of his triumphs,
and returning to Poland. He wished to withdraw
from the world and to settle in the country near his
family in the neighbourhood of Warsaw; there he
would establish schools for the people, and, without
troubling himself about the public, quietly pursue
his beloved art. With this idea in his mind, he
bade, as he thought, a short adieu to his betrothed,
and set off for Paris through Leipsic.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">LETTER FROM SCHUMANN.</span>
Frederic wrote to Robert Schumann, who, having
long desired to make his acquaintance, looked
anxiously forward to his arrival. Chopin on his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
side was very pleased to have a chance of becoming
acquainted with and personally expressing his regard
for so famous a man. It was about this meeting
that Schumann wrote the following letter to the
Chapel-master, Heinrich Dorn:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Leipsic, September, 6th, 1836.</i><a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My very dear Sir</span>,</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, just as I had received
your letter and was about to answer it, who should walk
in but Chopin. This was a great pleasure to me, and
we spent a delightful day together.... I have got
a new <i>ballade</i> of his; it seems to me the most pleasing
but not the cleverest of his works (genialischtes nicht
genialstes werk.) I told him I liked it best of all, and
after a long pause he said, with much emphasis, “I am
very glad you do, for it is my favourite also.”</p>

<p>He played also a host of new studies, nocturnes and
mazurkas, all of them inimitable. The way in which he
sits down to the piano is exceedingly impressive. You
would be very pleased with his playing; yet Clara is a
greater <i>virtuosa</i> than even he. Imagine to yourself
perfection unconscious of its own merit.</p></blockquote>

<p>Pleased with the warm reception of the German
artist Chopin quitted Leipsic after having cast a garland
on the monument of Prince Joseph Poniatowski.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>He was very busy with his own thoughts; he
believed that his wandering life was now ended, and
that with his new duties he would enter on a new
career. Thinking of his lovely bride he soared on
the rosy wings of fancy into an ideal land amidst
images of indescribable happiness and blessed hope.</p>

<p>Rough reality, alas! aroused him from his delicious
dreams, and inflicted a deep and painful
wound upon his heart. Some time after his return
to Paris, he learned that his bride had elected to
marry a count instead of an artist. The consequences
to Chopin were very serious: finding that
his hopes of an ideal union were shattered, to wipe
out and forget the insult he had received, he threw
himself into the arms of a woman who exercised a
very pernicious influence over him.</p>

<p class="center"><i>CHOPINʼS ACQUAINTANCE WITH GEORGE SAND.<br />
HIS LIFE AMONG HIS FRIENDS. WINTER SOJOURN
IN THE ISLAND OF MAJORCA (1838-1839)</i></p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 33px;">
<img src="images/i.jpg" width="33" height="60" alt="I" /></span>T
had been raining the whole day, and Chopin,
whose nerves were painfully affected by changes
of weather and especially by damp, was in wretched
spirits. None of his friends had been in to see him,
there were no new books to amuse or excite him,
and no melodious thoughts demanding expression
had presented themselves. At length, when it was
nearly ten oʼclock, it occurred to him to go to
Countess C.ʼs, who had her <i>jour fixe</i>, when an
intellectual and agreeable circle always assembled
in her <i>salon</i>. As he walked up the carpeted steps
Chopin imagined himself followed by a shadow,
exhaling an odour of violets; he had a feeling that
he was in the presence of something strange and
wonderful, and felt almost inclined to turn back;
then, laughing at his superstitiousness, he sprang
lightly up the remaining steps and entered the
room. A numerous company was assembled, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
mingled with the well-known faces, there were some
that he had not seen before.</p>

<p>The party had broken up into groups, talking,
with French grace and vivacity, of the theatre,
literature, politics and the events of the day. In
a humour for listening rather than talking, Chopin
sat down in a corner of the room and watched the
beautiful forms passing before him, for many charming
women frequented Countess C.ʼs.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">GEORGE SAND.</span>
When part of the company had gone and only the
intimate friends of the hostess remained, Chopin,
who was in the mood for weaving musical fairy
tales, (Märchen) sat down to the piano and improvised.
His hearers, whom in his absorption he had
quite forgotten, listened breathlessly. When he had
finished he looked up, and saw a simply dressed lady
leaning on the instrument and looking at him with
her dark passionate eyes as if she would read his
soul. Chopin felt himself blushing under her fascinating
gaze; she smiled slightly, and when he retired
behind a group of camelias he heard the rustling of
a silk dress, and perceived the odour of violets. The
lady who had looked at him so inquiringly while he
was at the piano was approaching with Liszt. In a
deep musical voice she said a few words about his
playing, and then spoke about the subject of his
improvisation. Frederic felt moved and flattered.
Undoubtedly the highest reward of the poet and
artist is to find themselves understood; and while
listening to the sparkling intellectual eloquence and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
poetry of her words, Chopin felt that he was appreciated
as he had never been before. This lady was
Aurora Dudevant, at that time the most celebrated
of French authoresses, whose romances, written
under the name of George Sand, were, of course,
well known to him. That night, when he returned
home, the pleasing words were still ringing in his
ears, the flashing glance was still dazzling his eyes.
But this first interview impressed his intellect only;
his heart and his sense of beauty were untouched.
He wrote to his parents, “I have made the acquaintance
of an important celebrity, Madame Dudevant,
well-known as George Sand; but I do not like her
face, there is something in it that repels me.” But
when he met this talented woman again, her attractive
conversation, in which was nearly always
hidden some delicate flattery, made him forget that
she was not beautiful. Her love for him&mdash;for George
Sand was passionately enamoured of Chopin&mdash;gave
to her decided and rather manly features a certain
attractive softness, and made her shy and almost
humble towards him; thus, unconsciously, she
stirred his heart. Frederic felt at first merely grateful
to her; then, if not as passionately, yet truly and
deeply he returned her love. The wound inflicted
by Mariaʼs faithlessness was healed. The consciousness
of being loved by the foremost of French
authoresses, a woman of European celebrity, filled
Frederic with happy pride. He was no longer alone
and solitary, for Aurora Dudevant was not only his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
beloved one, but an intellectual and steadfast friend
in whose heart he found a home from which fate
could never banish him.</p>

<p>He began about this time to withdraw from large
assemblies, and spent most of his time in communion
with his muse, and among a small circle of friends.
Always fastidious about his surroundings, he was
even more so now; but he always received his
intimate acquaintances with perfect good humour
and true Chopin amiability. Franz Liszt, Ferdinand
Hiller, and Baron von Stockhausen are, perhaps,
the only living representatives of those interesting
“soirées intimes” at Chopinʼs house in the Rue
Chaussée dʼAntin. Liszt writes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“His apartment was only lighted by some wax candles,
grouped round one of Pleyelʼs pianos, which he particularly
liked for their slightly veiled yet silvery sonorousness,
and easy touch, permitting him to elicit tones
which one might think proceeded from one of those
harmonicas of which romantic Germany has preserved
the monopoly, and which were so ingeniously constructed
by its ancient masters from the union of crystal
and water.</p>

<p>“As the corners of the room were left in obscurity, all
idea of limit was lost, so that there seemed no boundary
save the darkness of space. Some tall piece of furniture,
with its white cover, would reveal itself in the dim
light; an indistinct form, raising itself like a spectre to
listen to the sounds by which it had been evoked. The
light concentrated round the piano glided wave-like along
the floor mingling with the red flashes of fire-light.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
A solitary portrait, that of a pianist, a sympathetic friend
and admirer, seemed invited to be the constant auditor
of those sighing, murmuring, moaning tones which
ebbed and flowed upon the instrument. By a strange
accident, the polished surface of the mirror reflected,
so as to double for our eyes, the beautiful oval with the
silky curls which has so often been copied and of which
countless engravings have been reproduced for the
friends of the elegant composer.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS GUESTS.</span>
Among the frequent guests at this abode were:
Heinrich Heine, the German poet, of whom Enault
said that sarcasm had consumed his heart, and
scepticism swallowed up his soul; Meyerbeer, the
greatest dramatic musician of the day; Liszt, who
astonished the world with his magnificent impassioned
playing, and who, understanding the poetic
soul of the Polish artist, paid a literary tribute
in after years to his memory; Ferdinand Hiller,<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
a famous pianist and a warm and faithful friend
of Chopin; Ary Schäffer, the most classic of the
Romantic painters; Eugène Delacroix, who sought
for harmony of colour in Chopinʼs enchanting music;
Adolphe Nourrit, the celebrated singer, who, under
the influence of melancholy, committed suicide;
Baron von Stockhausen, ambassador of the King
of Hanover at the French court, a pupil and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>admirer of Chopin; and besides these, a little
band of his own countrymen, at whose head was
the veteran Niemcewicz, who had such an ardent
yearning for his fatherland that his one wish was to
rest from his labours in his native soil; Mickiewicz,
the greatest of Polish poets, who, ever dreaming
of his beloved Lithuania, celebrated its beauty in
verse worthy of a Homer; the favourite poet
Witwicki; Matuszynski, Fontana, Erzymala, and
last of all Mussetʼs “la femme à lʼœil sombre,”
who empoisoned the later life of our artist, so that
he might have said with a bleeding heart as Musset
did, “et si je ne crois plus aux larmes, cʼest que je
lʼai vu pleurer.” Only those who had seen Chopin
receiving these friends and gracefully dispensing true
Polish hospitality, and who had also been fortunate
enough to hear him improvise, could say that they
really knew him. The confidential talk of a small
circle would put him in the best of humours, and
he would often be as merry as in the early happy
days of youth in his fatherʼs house, before he had
become acquainted with the cares and troubles of
life.</p>

<p>Chopin was not fond of giving up his time to
others, but when he did, he did so entirely. If an
old friend or fellow-student from Warsaw came to
see him, he would immediately put off his pupils
and devote the day to his visitor. He would then
order a carriage, take his guest to breakfast on the
Boulevards, and drive around the suburbs (generally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
to Montmorency). After some hours of innocent
enjoyment in the country, they would return to
Paris, dine at one of the best restaurants, and finish
the day at the theatre. After that they would
occasionally go to some tea-garden or pleasure
“local,” where there would be no lack of amusement
and pretty dancers. On such occasion Frederic was
the Amphytrion of his guests, and would never suffer
<span class="sidenote">INJURIOUS EFFECTS OF PARISIAN LIFE.</span>
them to pay anything. This kind of Parisian life
could not but be injurious to Chopinʼs delicate constitution.
In the Autumn of 1837<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> he had, for the
first time, a pulmonary attack which much weakened
him. Both his friends and the physicians were very
anxious about his health; it was generally thought
that he was in consumption, and he was urged to
go to the South of France. Just at that time George
Sand was intending to go to the Island of Majorca
for the sake of her son Maurice, and pressed Chopin
to go with her. Frederic found it very hard to
leave Paris, and to separate himself from his doctor,
his friends, and his piano. He was by disposition
loth to break up pleasant associations, and every
change agitated him, but he could not say no to
a woman whom he so revered.</p>

<p>His friends did not think this journey at all advisable;
Frederic was not, however, very much exhausted
by it, but as soon as he landed, in November, 1838,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>he was taken dangerously ill. The cold and damp of
his first apartments gave him a violent cough, and the
new-comers were regarded with such evident dislike
by the occupants that they hastened to quit the house.
In Majorca, consumption was thought as infectious as
cholera and the plague, and no one would take in the
invalid. At length he and his friends found shelter
in a very lonely and slightly built house (karthaus)
called “Waldemosa,” which had just been vacated
by the monks. This cloister was situated in a
charming glen, surrounded by orange trees; but,
of course, in such a building there was not a trace
of comfort, and it did not contain a particle of
furniture. The winter that year was a very hard
one; it rained for a fortnight without ceasing, and
snow fell several times. Chopin, therefore, sent to
Marseilles for a stove and a piano; but, as he said
in writing to his parents, he was obliged to wait
for them a long time. When at length they arrived
the authorities and inhabitants of Palma were in a
great state of excitement; they regarded these
strange objects as diabolical machines intended to
blow up the town.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DANGEROUSLY ILL AT MAJORCA.</span>
Our artist did not receive the wished for benefit
from his stay in Majorca, but grew paler and
thinner every day. Although his complaint was
anything but chronic, all the doctors gave up attending
him. Chopin himself was perfectly composed
about his condition. The last physician whom
he had consulted, not thoroughly understanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
his disease, did not use the right means to arrest
it, and the bronchitis was followed by a nervous
agitation, which the doctor, not having observed
the contrary symptoms, treated as phthisis. He
ordered stimulating diet, bleeding, and a milk cure.
These measures were quite opposed to the nature of
the complaint. The effects of the loss of blood were
almost fatal, and Fredericʼs sufferings increased
daily. The doctor constantly insisted on bleeding,
but the friend, who nursed him with the utmost care,
seemed to hear a voice saying, “it is killing him.”
It soon appeared that this was a Providential presentiment.
The milk cure did not succeed; there
were no cows in the neighbourhood, and Frederic
did not like that which was substituted&mdash;goatʼs
milk.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The poor great artist! It was difficult sometimes
to know how to treat him,” says George Sand.<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
“What I feared, unhappily came to pass&mdash;he lost all
patience. He bore his bodily sufferings like a man, but
he could not bridle his ever restless imagination. The
house seemed to him full of spirits&mdash;spectres which
plagued him more than his pulmonary pains. He tried
to hide from us what was troubling him, but we soon
found it out. Coming back, one evening, about ten
oʼclock with my children from visiting the ruins of the
cloister, we found Chopin at the piano. His looks were
wild, his hair stood on end, and it was some seconds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>before he recognized us. Then he forced a smile and
began to play something. During the short time he had
been left alone, in his depression, a host of demoniacal
thoughts had, against his will, crowded upon him.</p>

<p>“While staying in this ‘card house,’ he composed
some short but very beautiful pieces, which he modestly
entitled ‘Preludes;’ they were real masterpieces. Some
of them create such vivid impressions that the shades of
the dead monks seem to rise and pass before the hearer
in solemn and gloomy funereal pomp.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> Others are full
of charm and melancholy glowing with the sparkling fire
of enthusiasm, breathing with the hope of restored
health. The laughter of children at play, the distant
strains of the guitar, the twitter of the birds on the damp
branches, or the sight of the little pale roses in our
cloister garden, pushing their heads up through the
snow, would call forth from his soul melodies of indescribable
sweetness and grace. But many also are so
full of gloom and sadness that, in spite of the pleasure
they afford, the listener is filled with pain.</p>

<p>“I apply this especially to a Prelude<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> he wrote one
evening, which thrills one almost to despair. One day
Maurice and I went to Palma to make some necessary
purchases. Chopin was pretty well when we left him.
Towards evening a heavy rain set in; the rivers swelled
rapidly; we lost our boots in the floods; our driver
deserted us; and we were exposed to great danger. It
was with difficulty that we accomplished a mile and a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
half in six hours, and we did not reach home till midnight.
We were greatly vexed at arriving so late, as we
knew our dear invalid would be very uneasy. We found
him, indeed, in a state of great agitation, and already
beginning to despair. With tears in his eyes he had
composed this noble and beautiful Prelude. When he
saw us come in, he jumped up with a cry, stood almost
motionless, and in a strange, hollow voice, exclaimed:
“Ah, I thought you were dead!” By degrees he grew
calm, but when he saw our soaked and ruined clothes,
the thought of the danger to which we had been exposed
again unnerved him. He told us afterwards that during
<span class="sidenote">AN UNEASY VISION.</span>
our absence he had had a vision, and that he could not
distinguish the dream from the reality. He had sunk
into a kind of stupor and fancied, while he was playing,
that he had been removed from earth, and was no longer
in the land of the living. He imagined that he was
drowned, and as he lay at the bottom of the sea could
feel the cold drops keeping time as they dropped upon
his breast. When I called his attention to the even fall
of the rain upon the roof, he obstinately maintained that
he had not heard it before.</p>

<p>“He was vexed with me for using the expression,
‘harmonie imitative,’ and he was right, for imitation is
an absurdity which can only tickle the ear. There was
in Chopinʼs genius a subtle innate harmony which
reflected the expression of his musical thoughts by a
lofty assonance of tone, not through the material repetition
of the outward sound. The Prelude he wrote that
evening recalls, indeed, the rain drops falling on the
roof of the cloister, but according to his conception these
drops are tears falling from heaven on his heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span></p>

<p>“As yet, no other genius has appeared so full of deep
poetic feeling as Chopin. Under his hand the piano
spoke an immortal longing. A short piece of scarcely
half a page will contain the most sublime poetry.
Chopinʼs rich genius never needed the aid of gross
material means. No! He required no trumpets and
ophicleides to awaken terror or enthusiasm. Hitherto
he has not been understood, and even now is not
generally appreciated. Musical taste and feeling must
make considerable progress before Chopinʼs works can
be popular.</p>

<p>“Chopin felt both his power and his weakness; the
latter arose from an excess of power which he did not
know how to control. He could not, like Mozart&mdash;who
in this capacity stands alone&mdash;create masterpieces from
common-place tones. Chopinʼs compositions contain
many surprises and <i>nuances</i> which are often strange,
mysterious, and original; but never far-fetched or
strained. Although he hated and avoided what was
incomprehensible, the over-intensity of his feelings
often carried him into regions to which he only
could attain.</p>

<p>“I fear that I was often a bad judge; for he was in
the habit of asking me for advice, as Molière did his
cook; and when I had come to know him intimately his
style was quite clear to me. During the eight years
in which I became increasingly familiar with his musical
thoughts, and had acquired an insight into his character,
I used to find in his playing either an exaltation, a
struggle and a victory, or else the agony of an over-mastering
thought. At that time I understood him
as he understood himself; a critic who knew him less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
intimately would perhaps have advised him to express
himself more clearly.</p>

<p>“In youth he was full of witty and merry thoughts, as
some simple yet exquisite Polish songs give evidence.
Some of his later tone-poems bring before us a sparkling
crystal stream reflecting the sunbeams. Chopinʼs quieter
compositions remind us of the song of the lark as it
lightly soars into the æther, or the gentle gliding of the
swan over the smooth mirror of the waters; they seemed
filled with the holy calm of nature. When Chopin was
in a desponding mood the piercing cry of the hungry
eagle among the crags of Majorca, the mournful wailing
of the storm, and the stern immoveability of the snow-clad
heights, would awaken gloomy fancies in his soul.
Then, again, the perfume of the orange blossoms, the
vine, bending to the earth beneath its rich burden, the
peasant singing his Moorish songs in the fields, would
fill him with delight.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS SENSITIVENESS.</span>
“Chopinʼs character thus showed itself in varying
circumstances; although sensitive to all marks of friendship
and smiles of favour, he would remember the
slightest offence for days and weeks together. The most
trivial <i>contre-temps</i> would disturb him exceedingly; but,
what is still more strange, real grief never troubled him
so much as small vexations. He could not overcome
this weakness of character, and his irritation was often
out of all proportion to the cause. He bore his illness
with heroic calm and courage; real dangers did not
frighten him, but, like very imaginative and nervous men,
he would torment himself ceaselessly with melancholy
thoughts.</p>

<p>“His excessive anxiety about trifles, his insuperable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>repugnance to the slightest sign of poverty, and his
luxurious habits, must have made his residence in
Majorca, after some days of illness, very distasteful
to him. But he was not in a condition to travel; and
when at last he had somewhat recovered, contrary winds
arose and the ship was obliged to lie at anchor for three
weeks. It was our only means of return, and unfortunately
we were not able to avail ourselves of it. Our
stay at the Cloister was a misery to Chopin and a hard
trial to me. His agreeableness and cheerful amiability
in society were frequently matched by the gloominess
and peevishness of his behaviour to those around him at
home, whom he sometimes drove almost to despair.
Yet I never knew anyone so noble-minded, tender, and
free from selfishness. He was a faithful and honest
friend. In happy moments his brilliant wit often surpassed
the cleverest sayings of the most eminent men;
and on matters which he thoroughly understood the
soundness of his judgment was incomparable. On the
other hand, you would rarely meet with a man of such exhaustless
imagination and such a strange and irritable
disposition. But who could quarrel with the talented
artist for the waywardness and peculiarities that were
the results of ill health? A broken rosebud, the shadow
of a passing chafer affected him as much as if he had
been bled or touched with glowing iron.</p>

<p>“The only objects he cared for were me and my
children; everything else in the South seem unbearable
to him. His impatience at the delay of our departure
did him more harm than all his vexation over the want
of comfort. Finally, at the latter end of the winter we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
were able to go to Barcelona and from thence to
Marseilles.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">PLAYING IN A CHURCH AT MARSEILLES.</span>
When they landed at this city Chopin learnt that
a funeral mass was to be performed for the celebrated
singer, Adolphe Nourrit,<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> who in a fit of
insanity had committed suicide. Frederic immediately
hurried into the church, and during the
service seated himself at the organ and played his
last improvisation in honour of his departed friend.</p>

<p class="center padb1"><i>RETURN TO PARIS. MOSCHELES AND LISZT.
CHOPIN AS A PIANOFORTE TEACHER.</i></p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 43px;">
<img src="images/a.jpg" width="43" height="60" alt="I" /></span>FTER spending a fine summer at Nohant, the
country residence of George Sand, Chopin
returned to Paris in the autumn. His health and
spirits had been excellent during the whole time,
and if not perfectly restored he was yet sufficiently
strong to resume his usual occupations. It appeared
that the doctors had been mistaken; what they took
for consumption turned out to be bronchitis; they,
therefore, strongly advised the artist to spare his
strength as much as possible and lead a very regular
life.</p>

<p>A tender mother or sister, or a loving and beloved
wife, would doubtless have succeeded in inducing
Frederic, who was naturally gentle and tractable, to
pay more regard to the delicacy of his constitution
and pursue quieter habits; but in Paris, where he
spent every evening at assemblies which lasted late
on into the night, he could not make up his mind to
stay at home and go to bed early. This exciting life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
was very injurious to him; the first symptoms of
consumption appeared, and increased in severity
year by year.</p>

<p>Chopin lived first in the Rue Tronchet, but he
soon moved to the Quai dʼOrleans, where he occupied
the “pavilion” of a house inhabited by George
Sand. “Chopin was very pleased to have a drawing
room in which he could play and dream; but he was
very fond of society, and used it chiefly to give
lessons in,” says George Sand; “it was only while
he was at Nohant that he composed.” His pupils
welcomed him back with great pleasure, and were
charmed with the preludes and the host of new
compositions which he brought with him.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p>In 1839 Moscheles, who had been desirous of
knowing the Polish <i>virtuoso</i>, arrived in Paris from
London. The two artists met for the first time at
an evening party at the house of Monsieur Leo, to
whom Chopin dedicated the Polonaise, op. 53. As
polished men of the world, they saluted each other
with the utmost courtesy, but went no further.
After this first brief meeting they were both invited
by King Louis Philippe to a concert at St. Cloud,
on November 29th.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A CONCERT AT ST. CLOUD.</span>
Chopin played before the royal family a nocturne
and some studies, and was, as Moscheles says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>“admired and petted as a favourite.” The German
artist then played some drawing-room pieces, and, in
conclusion, his Duet Sonata, with Chopin. Moscheles
thought Chopinʼs playing full of charm and life, and
in a letter to his wife he says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Chopinʼs appearance corresponds exactly with his
music; both are delicate and fanciful (schwärmerisch.)
He played to me at my request, and then for the first
time I really understood his music and saw the explanation
of the ladiesʼ enthusiasm. The <i>ad libitum</i> which
with his interpreters degenerates into bad time, is, when
he himself performs, the most charming originality of
execution; the harsh and dilettante-like modulations,
which I could never get over when playing his compositions,
ceased to offend when his delicate fairy-like
fingers glided over them; his <i>piano</i> is so delicate that
no very strong <i>forte</i> is required to give the desired
contrast. Thus we do not miss the orchestral effects
which the German school demands from a pianist, but
feel ourselves carried away as by a singer who, paying
little heed to the accompaniment, abandons himself to
his feelings. He is quite unique in the pianistic world.
He declared he liked my music very much; at any rate
he is well acquainted with it. He played his Studies,
and his last new work, the ‘Preludes,’ and I played
several of my works to him. Who would have thought
that, with all his sentimentality, Chopin had also a comic
vein? He was lively, merry, and extremely comic in
his mimicry of Pixis, Liszt, and a hunch-backed pianoforte
amateur.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Chopinʼs imitative talent displayed itself, as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
reader knows, in early youth, and increased so much
in after years that the French players, Boccage and
Madame Dorval, declared that they had never seen
anything of the kind so excellent before. My friend,
Joseph Nowakowski, a fellow-student of Chopin,
relates the following anecdotes:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPIN AN EXCELLENT MIMIC.</span>
“When I visited Chopin in Paris, I asked him to
introduce me to Kalkbrenner, Liszt, and Pixis, ‘That
is unnecessary,’ answered Chopin, ‘wait a moment, and
I will present them to you, but each separately.’ Then
he sat down to the piano after the fashion of Liszt,
played in his style and imitated all his movements to
the life; after which he impersonated Pixis. The next
evening I went to the theatre with Chopin. He left his
box for a short time, and turning round I saw Pixis
beside me. I thought it was Chopin, and I laughingly
clapped him on the shoulder, exclaiming, leave off your
mimicry. My neighbour was quite flabbergasted by such
familiarity on the part of a total stranger, but fortunately
at that moment Chopin returned to the box, and we had
a hearty laugh over the comical mistake. Then, with
his own peculiar grace of manner, he apologized both
for himself and me to the real Pixis.</p>

<p>“Liszt frequently met Chopin in society and had
many opportunities of observing his imitative talent.
He looked quietly on while Chopin mimicked him, and,
far from being offended, he laughed and seemed really
amused by it. There was not the slightest jealousy
between these two artists, and their friendship remained
unbroken.</p>

<p>“One day Chopin was asked at a party to play some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>of his latest works, and Liszt joined in the request. On
sitting down to the piano, Chopin noticed that there
were no pedals, and the hostess then remembered that
they had been sent away for repair and had not been
brought back. Liszt laughingly declared that he would
furnish them himself, and crawling under the piano he
knelt there while Chopin played, and completely supplied
the place of the pedals.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p>“Some years afterwards, in June, 1843, a large
number of artists were assembled at Nohant. Among
them were Liszt, the celebrated Pauline Viardot-Garcia,
whose incomparable power of ideal expression made her
the best interpreter of Chopinʼs Polish songs; the
painter, Eugène Delacroix, many of the best actors and
several eminent literary people. The hostess, with her
son and daughter and some married couples from the
neighbourhood, completed the party, all of whom were
young enough to be enthusiastic about art, and full of
hope.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CHOPIN AND LISZT.</span>
“One evening, when they were all assembled in the
<i>salon</i>, Liszt played one of Chopinʼs nocturnes, to which
he took the liberty of adding some embellishments.
Chopinʼs delicate intellectual face, which still bore the
traces of recent illness, looked disturbed; at last he
could not control himself any longer, and in that tone of
<i>sang froid</i> which he sometimes assumed he said, ‘I beg
you, my dear friend, when you do me the honour of
playing my compositions, to play them as they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
written or else not at all.’ ‘Play it yourself then,’ said
Liszt, rising from the piano, rather piqued. ‘With
pleasure,’ answered Chopin. At that moment a moth
fell into the lamp and extinguished it. They were going
to light it again when Chopin cried, ‘No, put out all the
lamps, the moonlight is quite enough.’ Then he began
to improvise and played for nearly an hour. And what
an improvisation it was! Description would be impossible,
for the feelings awakened by Chopinʼs magic
fingers are not transferable into words.</p>

<p>“When he left the piano his audience were in tears;
Liszt was deeply affected, and said to Chopin, as he
embraced him, ‘Yes, my friend, you were right; works
like yours ought not to be meddled with; other peopleʼs
alterations only spoil them. You are a true poet.’ ‘Oh,
it is nothing,’ returned Chopin, gaily, ‘We have each
our own style; that is all the difference between us.
You know, quite well, that nobody can play Beethoven
and Weber like you. Do play the Adagio from Beethovenʼs
C sharp minor Sonata, but nicely, as you can
do when you choose.’ Liszt began his Adagio, his
hearers were moved deeply, but in quite another manner.
They wept, but not tears of such sweetness as Chopin
had caused them to shed. Lisztʼs playing was less
elegiac, but more dramatic.”</p>

<p>“Some days afterwards,” writes Charles Rollinat, in
<i>Le Temps</i>, “We were once more the guests of George
Sand. Liszt asked Chopin to play, and, after a little
pressure, he consented. Liszt then desired the lights to
be put out and the curtains drawn that it might be
perfectly dark. This was done, and just as Chopin was
sitting down to the piano Liszt whispered something to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>him and took his place. Chopin seated himself in the
nearest arm chair, not dreaming of his friendʼs intention.
Liszt immediately began to improvise in the same
manner as Chopin had done on the former evening, and
so faithfully copied both sentiment and style that the
deception was perfect. The same signs of emotion were
again perceptible among the audience, and just as the
feeling reached its height Liszt lighted the candles on
the piano. A general cry of astonishment echoed
through the room. ‘What, it is you?’ ‘As you see,’
said Liszt, with a laugh. ‘But we made sure it was
Chopin playing,’ rejoined the company. In this ingenious
way Liszt revenged himself on his dangerous rival.</p>

<p>“Comedies were sometimes performed, or improvised
recitations delivered, the latter spontaneous and poetical,
as all true improvisations ought to be. There was a
theatre in George Sandʼs chateau, and also a great
variety of costumes. Only the subject of the piece and
the number of scenes needed to be given; the actors
improvised the dialogue. Liszt and Chopin were the
orchestra; they sat at two pianos right and left of the
stage behind some drapery, and followed the play with
appropriate music.</p>

<p>“Both artists were endowed with an astonishing
memory. They had at their command all the Italian,
French, and German operas of importance, and could
select, with marvellous readiness, motives adapted to
the particular situation, and work them out so effectively
and with such fervour that the actors&mdash;whose own
achievements were by no means inconsiderable&mdash;called
out from the stage, ‘Hold, you are too lavish with your
beauties.’</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A MUSICAL ECHO.</span>“In the middle of the garden was an esplanade, commanding
a view of the whole valley. A table, some
stone benches, and a light garden seat seemed to invite
the loiterer to stay and rest. The esplanade was surrounded
by a strong iron railing, to prevent the children
who played there from falling into the brook. The spot
was noted for a wonderful echo, which repeated every
word three or four times with perfect clearness. The
children often amused themselves in what they called
making the echo talk. One evening the thought occurred
to somebody of bringing out the piano and letting the
echo repeat fragments of romantic music. The idea
met with universal approval, and the magnificent Erard
Instrument was taken out on to the esplanade.</p>

<p>“It was a clear, still night in June; there was no
moon, but in the place of her silvery light shone a countless
host of stars. The piano was opened towards the
valley, and Lisztʼs energetic hands performed the well-known
hunting chorus from ‘Euryanthe.’ He stopped,
of course, to wait for the echo after each pause. Even
after the first we were all wild with enthusiasm; there
was something marvellously poetic in nature thus echoing
art. The musical phrase was too long both the first
and second time for the echo to give it back clearly;
but the third and fourth time the echo of the echo in the
chorus was beautifully repeated, without missing a note,
by the natural echo. Liszt himself felt the spell and
quickened the time. Every phrase excited the liveliest
curiosity and the most intense expectancy. One in
particular swept with a sweet melancholy sound over
the tops of the trees in the valley; but the last
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>announced the triumph of the human will over the
obstacles opposed by nature.</p>

<p>“After this most artistically managed Fanfare, Chopin
took Lisztʼs place and made the echo sing and weep.
He played some scraps from an impromptu which he
was at that time composing. Fredericʼs delight over
this diaphanous Æolian music knew no bounds; he
continued his converse with the spirits of the valley
much longer than Liszt had; it was a strange communion,
a whispering and a murmuring like a magic
incantation.</p>

<p>“The hostess was almost obliged to draw him by
force from the piano; he was in a state of feverish
excitement. When Chopin had finished playing, Pauline
Garcia sang the lovely naïve romance, ‘Nel cor piu non
mi sento.’ It was an excellent choice, for every phrase
consisted of only two notes, which, to the intense delight
of us all, the echo repeated with astonishing clearness.
Aurora had already begun to spread her rosy veil
before the party broke up, carrying with them not
only a delicious impression but, doubtless, an undying
recollection.”</p></blockquote>

<p>As is so often the case in life, the warm friendship
between Liszt and Chopin grew very cool in
after years, and finally died out altogether. On
whose side the fault lay I will not venture to decide,
but in some of the letters to his parents Chopin complains
bitterly of Liszt.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPIN AS A TEACHER.</span>
Having given up performing in public Chopin
occupied himself with giving lessons. His handsome
gentlemanly appearance, his great talents and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
brilliant fame, and his gift for teaching caused him
to be greatly esteemed and sought after, particularly
by the aristocracy. In taking pupils he always gave
the preference to his compatriots, and trained many
of his own countrywomen who have more or less
acquired his style and manner. Especially to be
mentioned are, Princess Marcelline Czartoryska <i>née</i>
Radziwill, the Countess Pauline Plater, Countess
L. Czosnowska, Countess Delphine Potocka, Princess
Beauvau, Madame Rosengart-Zaleska, Emilie Hofmann,
Baroness Bronicka, &amp;c. Among his non-Polish
pupils were: Madame Kalergi <i>née</i> Countess
Nesselrode, afterwards Madame de Muchanoff,
M<sup>dlles.</sup> Emma and Laura Harsford, Mademoiselle
Caroline Hartmann, Mademoiselle Lina Freppa,
Countess Flahault, Baroness C. de Rothschild,
Miss J. W. Sterling, Mademoiselle de Noailles,
Mademoiselle L. Duperré, Mademoiselle R. de Könneritz,
Princess Elizabeth Czernicheff, Countess
dʼAgoult, Princess C. de Souzzo, Countess dʼAppony,
Baroness dʼEst, M<sup>dlle.</sup> J. de Caraman, M<sup>dlle.</sup> C.
Maberly, Countess de Perthuis, Countess de Lobau,
Countess Adele de Fürstenstein, and M<sup>dlle.</sup> F.
Müller, to whom Chopin dedicated his Allegro de
Concert op. 46, and who has frequently been spoken
of as his most gifted and favourite lady pupil.</p>

<p>Unlike other great artists, Chopin felt no dislike
to giving lessons, but, on the contrary, took evident
pleasure in this laborious occupation, when he met
with talented and diligent pupils. He noticed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
slightest fault, but always in the kindest and most
encouraging manner, and never displayed anger
towards a dull pupil. But later on, when increasing
illness had made his nerves extremely irritable, he
would fling the music from the desk and make use of
very severe expressions. Not pencils merely, but
even chairs were broken by Chopinʼs apparently weak
hand; however, these outbursts of temper never
lasted long; a tear in the eye of the culprit at once
appeased the masterʼs wrath, and his kind heart was
anxious to make amends.</p>

<p>He could not endure thumping, and on one occasion
jumped up during a lesson, exclaiming, “What was
that, a dog barking?” Owing to the delicacy of his
nerves his playing was not so powerful as that of
other pianists, Liszt especially. This rendered the
first few lessons a real torture to his pupils. He
found most fault with a too noisy touch; his own
thin slender fingers rested horizontally on the keys,
which he seemed to stroke rather than strike.
Nevertheless he was quite able to produce vigorous
tones. It is a great error to suppose that his playing
was invariably soft and tender, although, in after
years, when he had not sufficient physical power for
performing the energetic passages, it lacked contrast,
but in his youth he displayed considerable fire and
energy, of which he never made any misuse.</p>

<p>Moscheles, in speaking of his playing at a <i>soirée</i>
at the Palace of King Louis Philippe in 1839, says,
“The audience must, I think, have caught the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
enthusiasm which Chopin threw into the piece
throughout.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS METHOD.</span>
He would not take a pupil who had not some
amount of technical skill, yet he made them all alike
begin with Clementiʼs “Gradus ad Parnassum.”
We see from this that his chief object was the
cultivation of the touch. The pre-eminence attached
to technical superiority by pianists of the present
day obliges them to devote their whole time to
acquiring mechanical dexterity and enormous force.
Thus they frequently lose their softness and lightness
of touch, and neglect the finer <i>nuances</i> and the
artistic finish of the phrasing.</p>

<p>The second requirement that Chopin made of a
new pupil was perfect independence of the fingers;
he, therefore, insisted on the practising of exercises,
and more especially the major and minor scales from
<i>piano</i> up to <i>fortissimo</i>, and with the <i>staccato</i> as well as
the <i>legato</i> touch, also with a change of accent, sometimes
marking the second, sometimes the third or
fourth note. By this means he obtained the perfect
independence of the fingers, and an agreeable equality
and delicacy of touch. Chopin thought of embodying
in a theoretical work the results of his long
years of study, experience, and observation of pianoforte
playing; but he had only written a few pages
when he fell ill. Unfortunately he destroyed the
manuscript shortly before his death.</p>

<p>Every poetical composition is a revelation of the
beautiful which the player ought to recognise, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
as far as possible interpret in the spirit of the composer.
To the many requests made to him for advice
Chopin invariably replied, “Play as you feel and
you will play well.” One day, when one of his
pupils was playing in a stiff, feelingless, mechanical
manner, he impatiently exclaimed, “Mettez y donc
toute votre âme.”</p>

<p>His friends relate that he used to lament greatly
over one pupil, who studied with indefatigable
diligence and perseverance, and possessed all the
qualities for becoming an artist of the first rank
except the most essential of all&mdash;feeling.</p>

<p>Yet how much mischief may arise from following
this true and simple maxim, “Play as you feel.”
How many celebrated pianists exaggerate or misunderstand
the meaning of Chopinʼs works! His
principle is only a sure and infallible guide when
the player has the capacity of perceiving the intentions
of the composer. This, unfortunately, is a
rare gift, and its absence in the rendering of Chopinʼs
compositions is doubly painful. He felt this himself,
and when one of his French pupils was being overwhelmed
with praise for his performance of one of
his masterʼs works, Chopin said, quickly, that he
had played the piece very well, but had quite missed
the Polish element and the Polish enthusiasm. Nor
did he confine this criticism to the interpretation
of distinctively Polish works, such as mazurkas and
polonaises, but applied it also to his concertos,
nocturnes, ballads, and studies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span></p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FEW GOOD INTERPRETERS OF CHOPIN.</span>
La Mara<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> was not wrong in saying that a correct
performance of Chopinʼs works was rarely to be had.
No one, be he ever so great a pianist, who cannot
sympathise with the misfortunes which have been
and are still the lot of the Pole, no one who does
not understand the melancholy characteristic of
the whole nation, can interpret Chopin with faithfulness.</p>

<p>One evening, in 1833 or 1834, there were assembled
at the house of the Castellan Count Plater three
great artists: Liszt, Hiller, and Chopin. A lively
discussion arose on national music, Chopin maintaining,
that no one who had not been in Poland
and inhaled the perfume of its meadows could have
any true sympathy with its folk-songs. As a test of
this it was proposed to play the well-known Mazurka,
“Poland is not lost yet.” Liszt played first, then
Hiller, each giving a different interpretation. Several
pianists followed; last of all came Chopin, whom
both Liszt and Hiller were obliged to admit far
surpassed them in comprehending the spirit of the
Mazurka.</p>

<p>There is, undoubtedly, a growing interest among
the public in Chopinʼs original compositions, but the
number of his interpreters who really understand
him is still very small. In some we find a certain
affectation and coquetry, in others only the poetic
frenzy (schwärmerei) which is infused into most of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>his works, while others again seek expression by
means of violent contrasts. These apparent diversities
are rarely combined in one individual, but it is
only in their union that we find the true Chopin
stamp of genius.</p>

<p>As the best means for acquiring a natural style
our master recommended the frequent hearing of
Italian singers, among whom there were at that
time many celebrities in Paris. He always applauded
their broad, simple style and the easy
manner in which they used and consequently preserved
their voices, as worthy the imitation of all
pianists, especially of those who hoped to attain
perfection. He advised his pupils not to break up
the musical thoughts, but to let them pour out in a
broad stream; he liked to hear in a player what in a
singer is understood by <i>portamento</i>. He hated any
exaggeration of accent which, in his opinion, destroyed
all the poetry of playing and made it appear
pedantic.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHARACTERISTICS OF CHOPINʼS PLAYING.</span>
Chopinʼs soft velvety fingers could evoke the most
exquisite effects. No other pianist of the day
possessed his executive skill and refined taste, or
equalled him in those passing embellishments which
he interwove into his playing, and which resembled
filagree work or the most delicate Brabant lace. He
was very fond of playing to himself or some favourite
pupil the works of Sebastian Bach, which he had
studied with the utmost accuracy and completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
mastered.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> The <i>tempo rubato</i> was a special characteristic
of Chopinʼs playing. He would keep the
bass quiet and steady, while the right hand moved
in free <i>tempo</i>, sometimes with the left hand, and
sometimes quite independently, as, for example,
when it plays quaver, trills, or those magic, rhythmical
runs and <i>fioritures</i> peculiar to Chopin. “The
left hand,” he used to say, “should be like a bandmaster,
and never for a moment become unsteady or
falter.”</p>

<p>By this means his playing was free from the
trammels of measure and acquired its peculiar charm.
The outlines, like those in a good painting of a
winter landscape, shade off into a transparent mist.
He used the <i>tempo rubato</i> with great effect, not only
in his nocturnes but also in many of his mazurkas.
Those who have entered into the spirit of Chopinʼs
works will easily see when to use the <i>rubato</i>. Chopin
rendered the <i>tremolo</i> to perfection, making the
melody float like a boat on the bosom of the waters.
Liszt says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Chopin was the first to use the <i>tempo rubato</i>, which
gave such an original stamp to his compositions: an
evanescent, interrupted measure, ductile, abrupt, yet
languishing, and flickering like a flame in the breeze.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>In his later works he left off marking <i>tempo rubato</i> at
the commencement of a piece, considering that whoever
understood it would of himself discover this law of
latitude. Chopinʼs works require to be played with a
certain accent and swing which it is difficult for anyone
to acquire who has not had frequent opportunities of
hearing him play. He seemed very anxious to impart
this style to his pupils, and especially to his compatriots.
His Polish pupils, particularly the ladies, acquired this
method with all the quick sensitiveness which they
possess for poetic feeling; and their innate perception of
his thoughts enabled them to follow faithfully all the
undulations on his azure sea of sentiment.”</p></blockquote>

<p>While Chopin was strong and healthy, as during
the first years of his residence in Paris, he used to
play on an Erard piano; but after his friend Camillo
Pleyel had made him a present of one of his splendid
instruments, remarkable for their metallic ring and
very light touch, he would play on no other makerʼs.
If he were engaged for a <i>soirée</i> at one of his Polish or
French friends, he would often send his own instrument,
if there did not happen to be a Pleyel in the
house. “Quand je suis mal disposé,” said Chopin,
“je joue sur un piano dʼErard et jʼy trouve facilement
un son fait. Mais quand je me sens en verve
et assez fort, pour trouver mon propre son à moi, il
me faut un piano de Pleyel.”</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS REVERENCE FOR ART.</span>
Chopin sacredly cherished art as one of heavenʼs
best gifts, as a gentle comforter in sorrow, and would
never put it to any common-place purpose. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
are, unfortunately, plenty of famous artists who
regard their art merely as a means of subsistence.
What Schiller says of men of science is no less true
of artists:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Einem ist sie die hohe, die himmlische Göttin, dem Andern</div>
<div class="line">Eine Tüchtige Kuh, die ihn mit Butter versorgt.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Throughout his life art was to Chopin a lofty
goddess. He was frequently asked by wealthy and
aristocratic personages to give instruction to them
or to their relations, but the largest honorarium could
not induce him to teach anyone devoid of talent;
although at that time he had long ceased to receive
anything from his parents, was very particular about
the appointments of his household, fond of giving
presents, and always dispensed a most liberal hospitality.
In a pleasant manner&mdash;and, indeed, no other
was possible to him&mdash;Chopin would refuse on the
score of not increasing the number of his pupils.
Young people of talent he would encourage with the
sincerest kindness, lending them books, music, and
sometimes money even, when he found their means
were limited; many he taught gratuitously. One of
his most talented pupils was Filtsch,<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> a young
Hungarian; Chopin thought a great deal of him, and
always delighted in his company. His premature
death made a deep and painful impression on our
master. All who knew Filtsch intimately, and had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>heard his beautiful playing, say that he would have
fulfilled the most splendid hopes, and unite in deploring
his death as a sad loss to the musical world.</p>

<p>Among Chopinʼs best pupils we must name:
Gutmann, Guntsberg; Telefsen; George Mathias,
who is now a professor at the Paris Conservatoire;
Charles Mikuli, director of the Musical Union, at
Lemberg; Casimir Wernick, who died young, at
St. Petersburg, in 1859; and Gustav Schumann, a
much esteemed pianist in Berlin, who only went to
Paris for a short time to receive instruction from
Chopin.</p>

<p>Chopin was not only respected but loved by all
his pupils for his warm sympathy and exceedingly
fascinating manners. To Polish artists he was
especially amiable and kind, and ever ready to serve
them in any way; thus, showing that his love for
his fatherland was as warm as when a dreamy,
gentle boy, his parentsʼ house in Poland was all the
world to him. So it came to pass that many artists,
who were only spending a short time in Paris, but
were anxious to acquire fame and popularity, gave
themselves out as Chopinʼs pupils, although he did
not even know their names. When asked if such a
one were his pupil, he would answer, “I never
taught him, but if it is any benefit to him to be
called my pupil, let him enjoy it in peace.” Chopin
was not only a kind, but also a conscientious teacher.
He never gave more than four or, at the utmost, five
lessons a day for his healthʼs sake, but he attended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
regularly to those and never put off his pupils, except
when he was very ill, or when friends and acquaintances
from Poland came to see him. Carriages
were frequently sent for him by those of his pupils
living at a distance, but in the last years of his life
they were obliged to come to him, and when he
became so weak that he could scarcely sit up, he
would give lessons lying on a <i>chaise longue</i> before a
pianette, with the pupil seated at another instrument.
If a passage were played wrongly or not
according to his taste, he would raise himself up and
play it, and then lie down again.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">SCHULHOFF INTRODUCED TO CHOPIN.</span>
His noble character and truly artistic nature appeared
on all occasions; the following episode is a
proof of his excellent disposition. Julius Schulhoff
came to Paris when a young man, and completely
unknown. One day he heard that Chopin, who was
at that time in very bad health and difficult of access,
was going to Mercierʼs<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> piano manufactory to see a
newly invented <i>transpositeur</i>. This was in 1844.
Schulhoff availed himself of this opportunity for
making the masterʼs acquaintance, and was among
the little band awaiting the arrival of Chopin, who
came accompanied by an old friend, a Russian bandmaster.
Seizing a favourable moment, Schulhoff
asked a lady present to introduce him. To her
request that he should play something to Chopin,
the great artist, who was frequently tormented by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>the visitations of <i>dilettanti</i>, reluctantly acceded by a
slight nod. Schulhoff sat down to the piano, while
Chopin, with his back to him, leant against it. But
after the first few chords he turned his head to
Schulhoff, who was playing his new “Allegro brillant
en forme de Sonate,” which he afterwards dedicated
to Chopin as op. 1.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> Chopin drew nearer and nearer,
listening with growing interest to the refined, poetical
playing of the young Bohemian; his pale face
lighted up, and by look and gesture he testified his
warm approval. When Schulhoff had finished,
Chopin held out his hand, saying, “Vous êtes un
vrai artiste&mdash;un collègue.” A few days afterwards
Schulhoff paid him a visit, and begged him to accept
the dedication of the “Allegro;” the master thanked
him in his most winning manner, and some ladies
present heard him say, “Je suis très flatté de
lʼhonneur que vous me faites.”</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 32px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="32" height="60" alt="I" /></span>HE fears of the Physicians began to be realized.
Chopinʼs manner of life in Paris was quite
contrary to their advice, and the saddest results
ensued. In 1840 decided symptoms of an affection
of the lungs appeared. The sufferer was much
troubled by sleeplessness, and during those restless
nights his active and versatile imagination conjured
up the gloomiest fancies. The gravity of the situation
was now unmistakable. His annual visit to
Nohant always gave him some relief; there he could
live in perfect freedom, and work or rest as he felt
inclined. But the winter unfortunately increased
his sufferings, and the sharp cold winds destroyed all
the good effected by the mild air of Nohant.</p>

<p>On May 3rd, 1844, Frederic received a heavy
shock in the death of his dearly beloved father. The
sad intelligence quite prostrated him; and he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
agonized by the thought that he had not been able
to soothe his parentʼs last moments, and receive his
blessing and farewell. Frederic felt that he ought to
write to comfort his mother and sisters, and mingle
his tears with theirs, if only by letter; but, as often
as he resolved to do so, his strength failed him. At
<span class="sidenote">GEORGE SAND TO MADAME CHOPIN.</span>
length George Sand, who was at that time still faithful
to Chopin, undertook the sad duty, and wrote
expressing her sympathy with the mother of the
man whom once she had so passionately loved, and
for whom she still cherished friendship and respect.
The following is an exact transcription of her letter:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, le 29 Mai, 1844.</i></p>

<p>Je ne crois pas pouvoir offrir dʼautre consolation à
lʼexcellente mère de mon cher Frédéric, que lʼassurance
du courage et de la résignation de cet admirable enfant.
Vous savez si sa douleur est profonde et si son âme est
accablée; mais grâce à Dieu, il nʼest pas malade, et nous
partons dans quelques heures pour la compagne, où il
se reposera enfin dʼune si terrible crise.</p>

<p>Il ne pense quʼà vous, à ses soeurs, à tous les siens,
quʼil chérit si ardemment, et dont lʼaffliction lʼinquiète et
le préoccupe autant que la sienne propre.</p>

<p>Du moins, ne soyez pas de votre côté inquiète de
sa situation extérieure. Je ne peux pas lui ôter cette
peine si profonde, si légitime et si durable; mais je puis
du moins soigner sa santé et lʼentourer dʼautant dʼaffection
et de précautions que vous le feriez vous même.</p>

<p>Cʼest un devoir bien doux que je me suis imposé
avec bonheur et auquel je ne manquerai jamais.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span></p>

<p>Je vous le promets, Madame, et jʼespère que vous
avez confiance en mon dévouement pour lui. Je ne vous
dis pas que votre malheur mʼa frappée autant que si
jʼavais connu lʼhomme admirable que vous pleurez. Ma
sympathie, quelque vraie quʼelle soit, ne peut adoucir ce
coup terrible, mais en vous disant que je consacrerai mes
jours à son fils, et que je le regarde comme le mien
propre, je sais que je puis vous donner de ce côte-là
quelque tranquillité dʼesprit. Cʼest pourquoi jʼai pris la
liberté de vous écrire pour vous dire que je vous suis
profondément dévouée, comme à la mère adorée de mon
plus cher ami.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">GEORGE SAND TO A. THIES.</span>
Among Chopinʼs friends and admirers was Alexander
Thies,<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> of Warsaw. He had often seen
Frederic in Paris, and through him had become
acquainted with George Sand, whom as a writer he
greatly admired. He wrote from Warsaw a kind
letter of inquiry about Chopin and Mickiewicz, and
in conclusion wished good health, prosperity, and
fame to George Sand. I mention these three
words particularly that the following reply may
be intelligible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, le 25 Mars 1845.</i></p>

<p>Monsieur!</p>

<p>Nous sommes bien coupables envers vous, moi
surtout; car lui (<i>Chopin</i>), écrit si peu et il a tant
dʼexcuses dans son état continuel de fatigue et de
souffrance, que vous devez lui pardonner. Jʼespérais
toujours lʼamener à vous écrire, mais je nʼai eu que
des résolutions et des promesses, et je prends le parti
de commencer, sauf à ne pas obtenir, entre sa toux et
ses leçons, un instant de repos et de calme.</p>

<p>Cʼest vous dire que sa santé est toujours aussi
chancelante. Depuis les grands froids quʼil a fait ici,
il a été surtout accablé; jʼen suis presque toujours
malade aussi, et aujourdʼhui je vous écris avec un reste
de fièvre. Mais vous? Vous souffrez plus que nous,
et vous en parlez à peine. Vous êtes un stoïque de
chrétien, et il y a bien dʼassez belles et grandes choses
dans votre doctrine, pour que je vous passe la forme,
sur ce point. Vous ne me convertirez pas. Mais que
vous importe? Vous nʼêtes pas, je lʼespère, de ces
catholiques farouches, qui damnent sans retour les
dissidents. Dʼailleurs, lʼorthodoxie de ces principes
dʼintolérance est très controversée, et votre grand coeur
peut prendre là-dessus le parti qui lui convient; moi,
jʼai lʼespoir dʼêtre sauvée tout comme une autre, bien
que jʼai fait le mal plus dʼune fois tout comme une
autre. Mais il y a plus de miséricorde là-haut quʼil nʼy
a de crimes ici-bas. Autrement, ce ne serait pas la
justice divine, ce serait la justice humaine, la peine
du faible. Blasphème inique et que je repousse avec
horreur.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<p>Je ne vous dirai rien de <i>Mickiewicz</i>, il nʼa pas fait
son cours cette année, et je ne lʼai pas vu<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>. Je nʼai
même pas lu son livre. Je le regarde aussi comme un
noble malade, mais sans le croire sur le chemin de la
vérité, je le crois aussi bien que vous et moi sur la route
du salut; sʼil est dans son erreur convaincu, humble et
aimant Dieu, Dieu ne lʼabandonnera pas, Dieu ne boude
pas, et je ne puis croire quʼune telle âme ne soulève pas
quelque coin du voile étrange dont il sʼenveloppait
lʼannée dernière.</p>

<p>Je vous remercie de vos souhaits affectueux, santé
bien-être et gloire; tout cela est chimère. Nous sommes
ici-bas pour souffrir et travailler; la santé est une bénédiction
du ciel, en tant quʼelle nous rend utiles à ceux
qui ne lʼont pas; le bien-être est impossible à quiconque
veut assister ses frères, car dans ce cas-là, plus il peut
recevoir, plus il doit donner. La gloire est une niaiserie
pour amuser les enfants. Une âme sérieuse ne peut y
voir autre chose que le résultat douloureux de lʼignorance
des hommes, prompts à sʼengouer de peu de chose.
La santé serait donc le seul bien désirable dans vos trois
souhaits. Mais je ne lʼai pas cette année et je ne
murmure pas, puisque vous, qui le méritez mieux que
moi, vous ne lʼavez pas retrouvée.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Espérez-vous maintenant en cette cure que vous avez
entreprise avec tant de courage? Ecrivez-moi donc que
vous êtes mieux; cela nous consolerait de nʼêtre pas
bien. Eh quand nous revenez-vous? Nous nʼirons pas
de bonne heure à la campagne, si le printemps est aussi
laid que lʼhiver. Jʼespère donc que nous vous reverrons
ici, et si vous tardez, nous voulons vous voir à Nohant.
Vous devez nous dédommager dʼy être restés si peu
lʼautre fois. Mes enfants vous remercient de votre bon
souvenir et font aussi des voeux pour vous.</p>

<p>A vous de coeur, toujours et bien sincèrement, vous
le savez.</p>

<p class="right">GEORGE SAND.</p></blockquote>

<p>The letters of George Sand show that Chopinʼs
condition was already regarded as hopeless. Soon
after the death of his father, the poor invalid, who
so much needed comforting and cheering, had to
bear another grief in the loss of his dearest friend
in Paris, Johann Matuszynski. As his physical
sufferings increased, he grew melancholy and was
haunted by the most dismal imaginations. George
Sand speaks of this in writing to a friend who knew
him well:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The Catholic faith, by teaching the doctrine of a
purgatorial fire, represents death in a terrible light.
Far from picturing the soul of a beloved one in a
better world, Chopin often had dreadful visions, and
I was obliged to spend the night near his sleeping
apartment, to dispel the spectres of his dreaming and
waking hours. He dwells a great deal on the superstitions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
of Polish tradition. The spirits harass and
entangle him in their magic circle, and instead of
seeing his father and friend smiling at him from the
abodes of the glorified, as the Lutheran doctrine teaches,
he imagines that their lifeless forms are at his bedside,
or that he is tearing himself from their cold embrace.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">INCREASING ILLNESS.</span>
Month by month the disease made rapid strides,
and his strength perceptibly diminished. The cough
grew more obstinate, and very often he was so weak
and suffered so from want of breath, that when he
went to see his friends he was obliged to be carried
upstairs.</p>

<p>The following are the compositions written between
1843 and 1847: Polonaise, op. 53; Berceuse,
op. 57; Sonata in B minor, op. 58; Mazurkas, op.
59 and 63; Barcarole, op. 60; Polonaise-Fantasia,
op. 61, and Sonata in G minor for piano and violincello,
op. 65. These pieces are throughout beautiful,
and poetical, but the melancholy and peculiar agitation
displayed, especially in the two last, reveal
the morbid mind of the composer. The musical
thoughts have not the pleasing clearness of his earlier
works and not infrequently border on eccentricity.
But how full of sorrow and suffering had these years
been to the delicately wrought spirit of the artist
with its natural inclination to melancholy.</p>

<p>Chopin who, in spite of his self-absorption, noticed
everything that went on around him&mdash;his innate
sensitiveness of feeling supplying the place of observation&mdash;could
no longer conceal from himself, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
the woman who had attracted him by the intensity
of her love, and won the devotion of his deeply
poetical nature, that she, whose steadfastness had
seemed firm as a rock, was daily wavering in her
affection. His pride whispered, “leave her, she
regards you as a burden;” but the moral feeling
fostered by his education, and his parentsʼ noble
example of wedded faithfulness and constancy,
exhorted him to stay.</p>

<p>There were times during his youth when Chopin
felt some scruples about his illegitimate connection
with Aurora Dudevant-Sand, when he sincerely
wished that he could lead her to the altar, and
cursed the fate which hindered him. Afterwards
he consoled himself with the thought that the firmness
of the bond on both sides made it sacred, and
unquestionably nothing on earth would have moved
him to separate from her.</p>

<p>George Sand thought otherwise. This fanciful
woman, with her keen susceptibilities for the beautiful,
had loved the young, interesting, and celebrated
composer; but the dejected invalid was an incumbrance.
Her change of feeling was first manifested
by occasional sullen looks and by the increasing
shortness of her visits to the sick room. Chopin
felt much pained, but was silent, for according to his
ideas it would have been dishonourable on his part
to cause a breach. His strength of will was impaired
by broken health, and he submitted patiently
to innumerable little mortifications which, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
wounded him deeply; his moral sense told him that
he ought to atone for the wrong he had done in
taking this woman unlawfully to himself.</p>

<p>He was grieved at the complaints she often made in
his presence of the fatigue of nursing him; he begged
her to leave him alone and go out into the open air;
he entreated her not to give up her amusements for
his sake, but to go to the theatre and give parties,
&amp;c.; he should be quiet and contented if he knew
that she were happy. At last, before the sick man
had dreamed of a separation, an heroic expedient,
as Count Stanisla Tarnowski says, was resorted to.
<span class="sidenote">“LUCREZIA FLORIANI.”</span>
George Sand had written a romance, entitled,
“Lucrezia Floriani,” of which the following is a
brief summary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Prince Charles, a man of a noble and sympathetic
character, but sickly, nervous, jealous, proud, and full
of aristocratic notions, falls passionately in love with
Lucrezia, a woman no longer young, who has given up
love and the world, and lives only for her children and
to do good. She is a famous artist, who does not pretend
to be better than she is, but who is better than she is
said to be. This consuming love causes Prince Charles
a severe illness which endangers his life. Lucrezia saves
him and loves him; but, foreseeing that this love would
be a misery to her, conceals it. Prince Charlesʼs feelings,
however, growing more and more passionate and again
threatening his safety, the object of his adoration gives
herself up to him.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is strange how women of a certain age like to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
hide their feelings under the cloak of sacrifice and
motherly care. <i>They</i> are not in love, but the weak,
sick, nervous being needs support and tenderness.
Thus is produced that painful and disagreeable
counterfeit of motherly affection which we so often
meet with, as in “Lucrezia Floriani.”</p>

<p>“Whence,” asks the writer of the romance, “arises
this unnatural specious feeling? Perhaps if a heroine
loves at that age, when, as Hamlet says, ‘the heyday
in the blood is tame,’ she feels degraded in her
own eyes and in those of the world, and to regain
her position, and gloss over her real feelings and
actions, she makes a pretext of sacrifice and tender
care.” In this way the famous Madame de Warrens
interpreted her sacrifice, of which J. J. Rousseau says
so much in his “Confessions;” and thus Lucrezia
explained her love for Charles.</p>

<p>For two months she was unspeakably happy; then
everything changed. Charles grows jealous, unreasonable,
and capricious; he cannot bear the
sight of Lucreziaʼs old friends. There are constant
outbursts of anger and nervous excitement, or fits of
madness and desperation. Wearied and harassed,
Lucreziaʼs health and strength give way; but of
this she makes a secret and never complains because
she has vowed to make any sacrifice for Charles.
She knows that she will die&mdash;for Charles will make
a martyr of her&mdash;and that her children will be
orphans, yet she goes on suffering in silence because
she has pledged herself to be faithful to him. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
a few years of a life of such constant torture, and of
alienation from her friends on account of the jealousy
of Charles, she ceases to love him and submits
resignedly to her fate. At length, exhausted by protracted
self sacrifice, Lucrezia dies.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">A LITERARY PORTRAIT OF CHOPIN.</span>
It was at that time generally thought that Prince
Charles was a portrait of Chopin, although the
exaggeration with which the character was drawn
made it a caricature. The love story in the romance
certainly bore a strong resemblance to the connection
between himself and George Sand, which, with all
its happiness, was, as none better than he knew,
a very painful one. Both Frederic and the world
were well aware that the real Lucrezia was not
a victim to her devotedness, and that the Charles
of the novel could be none other than Chopin. It is
said that, by a refinement of cruelty, the proofs were
sent to him for correction; it is a matter of fact,
however, that George Sandʼs children said to him,
“Monsieur Chopin, do you know that Prince Charles
is meant for you?”</p>

<p>Everyone acquainted with the circumstances
blamed the authoress. She excused herself,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> saying
that she had been misunderstood, and that the
intention imputed to her had no existence.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“But,” said she by way of justification, “Charles is
not an artist or a genius; he is only a dreamer. His
character scarcely rises above the common-place; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>never appears amiable, and has, indeed, so little in
common with that of the great composer, that Chopin,
although he every day reads the manuscript off my
writing table and is very suspicious about other things,
never imagined that any reference was intended to himself.
Afterwards, indeed, the malicious whisperings of
some of his friends, who were enemies to me, made him
fancy, that in Prince Charles I was describing him, and
in the martyr Lucrezia, myself; and that this romance
depicted the relations between us. His memory was at
that time very weak, and when a garbled version of the
story was presented to him, he had quite forgotten the
real description of the character and circumstances of
Prince Charles. Why did he not read my novel again?”</p></blockquote>

<p>Madame Sand much regretted that Matuszynski
was not living when a breach between herself and
Chopin had become inevitable. “His friendship for
Chopin and the influence he had over him would,”
said the authoress, “have rendered innocuous the
whisperings of intriguers, and if a separation had
taken place at all, his mediation would have made
it less violent and painful.”</p>

<p>The sick and enfeebled artist suffered, however,
most keenly from the mortification which he received
from this book. “If,” he reflected, “I now desert
the woman whom I formerly esteemed and loved,
I make the romance a reality, and expose her to the
blame, nay, even the scorn of the strictly virtuous.”
He nobly struggled on, retreating more and more
into himself, till at last he could bear it no longer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<p>In the beginning of 1847, during a violent scene,
of which her daughter was the innocent cause,
George Sand brought about a complete rupture. To
her unjust reproaches he only replied, “I shall leave
your house immediately, and I only desire that my
existence may be blotted out from your memory.”
To these words George Sand offered no objection,
for they were just what she desired, and the same
day the artist quitted her for ever.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">GUTMANNʼS DEVOTED CARE.</span>
Agitation and grief again laid him on a sick bed,
and his friends were long and seriously afraid that he
would only exchange it for his coffin. Gutmann,
his favourite pupil, and one of his best friends, nursed
him with the most devoted care; and the deep
gratitude of the sufferer was shown by the questions
which he continually asked of the friends
and acquaintances who came to see him. “How is
Gutmann? Is he not very tired? Will it not be
too much for him if he sits up with me any longer?
I am sorry to give him so much trouble, but there is
no one else I like so well to have about me as him.”
These were almost the only words he spoke, for his
visitors would not let him talk, and did all they
could to amuse him and divert his mind.</p>

<p>Through the efforts of the physicians and the
indefatigable attentions of Gutmann, Chopin at
length somewhat recovered. But the first time he
appeared again among his friends he was so much
altered that they hardly knew him. The following
summer he was apparently much better, and able to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
compose; but he would not leave Paris, as was his
constant habit at that time of year, and was thus
deprived of the fresh country air which had always
been so beneficial to him.</p>

<p>During the winter of 1847-1848 Chopin was in a
very precarious state of health. Political disturbances
and other causes made his residence in Paris
increasingly unpleasant, and he resolved on visiting
England, where he had many very kind friends, who
had repeatedly invited him to come whenever he had
time. But before leaving the queen of Continental
cities he wished to give a farewell public concert.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
It took place on February 16th, 1848, at the Pleyel
Hall, and Chopin could not have desired a more
select and distinguished audience, or a more enthusiastic
reception.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> Many of the most exalted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
personages and the first artists in Paris were present,
and throughout the performance all were anxious to
testify their respect and admiration for the talented
composer, the rare <i>virtuoso</i> and the loveable man.
Frederic was deeply affected; this, the last of his
Parisian triumphs, was a balsam for many of the
wounds of fate which, although gradually healing,
were still sometimes very painful.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">OVERTHROW OF THE ORLEANISTS.</span>
Chopin was greatly shocked by the political events
of February 23rd, which overthrew a dynasty, and
sent a monarch and his family into exile. From
Louis Philippe and his kindred he had experienced
nothing but affability and kindness, and Frederic
deplored the fate of the Orleanists. At the same
time, however, this revolution awakened fresh hopes
for his unfortunate country, which he loved as
passionately and faithfully as when, a youth in
Warsaw, he set to music patriotic songs which
it was unsafe to publish. But when he saw that the
storm which swept over Europe brought neither
freedom nor independence to Poland, he suppressed
his longings, and in talking of politics rarely gave
vent to the feelings of his over-charged heart.</p>

<p>There was now nothing to prevent his journey to
England. His friends, much as they liked his company,
did not dissuade him from his purpose, and
hoped that he would soon feel at home in London.
At the latter end of March, just a month before his
departure, he was invited to a <i>soirée</i> by a lady, at
whose hospitable house he had, in former days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
been a frequent guest. He hesitated before deciding
to go, for during the last four years he had not been
often seen in the Parisian <i>salons</i>; then, as if moved
by an inward premonition, he accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>A lively conversation about Chopin had been
going on at Madame H.ʼs before he arrived. A
musical connoisseur was describing his meeting with
the famous artist at Nohant, and his wonderful
playing on the beautiful summer moonlight night.
A lady observed: “Chopinʼs spirit pervades the
best of Sandʼs romances. Like all highly imaginative
writers, she often lost patience over her work, because
before she had carried out one plan her mind was
advancing to something fresh. To keep herself to
her desk and to enable her to write with more care,
she would ask her lover to improvise on the piano,
and thus, inspired by his playing, she produced her
best novels.”</p>

<p>A deep, half audible, sigh escaped from a lady,
who, unobserved by the speaker, had stepped softly
into the <i>salon</i> from the adjoining room. A flush
overspread her pale face, tears stood in her deep
mysterious eyes; what could have moved her so
profoundly?</p>

<p>Several gentlemen then entered the room, and the
lady retreated behind a mass of ivy which formed
a convenient screen. She sat there for about an
hour, unnoticed except by the hostess, who understood
her behaviour. When the company had
become more numerous the lady rose, and, walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
up to Chopin, with the swinging step peculiar to
her, held out her hand. “Frederic,” she murmured,
in a voice audible only to him, and standing
before him he saw, for the first time, after a long and
painful separation, George Sand, repentant, and
evidently anxious for reconciliation. His delicate,
emaciated, yet still beautiful face, grew deadly pale;
for a moment his soft eyes met hers with an inquiring
look, and then he turned away and left
the room in silence.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">WARM RECEPTION IN ENGLAND.</span>
Towards the end of April he bade adieu to his
friends and set off for London. In England Chopinʼs
works already enjoyed a well-deserved esteem and
popularity; he was, therefore, everywhere received
with unusual marks of respect and with that hearty
sympathy which is the best reward of the poet and
artist. The hospitality and kindness of his old
friends, and the courtesy of his new acquaintances,
were very grateful to Fredericʼs sensitive and affectionate
nature. He again appeared in society, and
hoped that, while pursuing his beloved art amid fresh
surroundings, he might forget the woman for whom,
notwithstanding all the wrong she had done him,
he sometimes ardently longed. He could not, despite
all his efforts, erase from his memory the period of
almost supernal happiness once created for him by
her dazzling intellect, exhaustless fancy, and ardent
love, although his reason constantly told him that
she was not worthy of a sigh.</p>

<p>After he had been presented to the Queen by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
Duchess of Sutherland, and had played at Court, he
daily received invitations from the first families, and
became, finally, a noted favourite. The late evening
parties, the want of sleep, and the wear and tear of
<i>salon</i> life, were very injurious to his weak constitution,
and quite opposed to the doctorsʼ orders. For
the sake of quiet he accepted an invitation to
Scotland, but, as might have been expected, the
climate was too severe for him. The prevalent
mists, so trying to nervous temperaments, affected
his spirits, and induced that melancholy which had
often troubled him in early years, and become infused
into his earnest and wildly romantic compositions.
He writes from Scotland to his friend Grzymala:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">VISIT TO SCOTLAND.</span>
“I have played at a concert in Glasgow before all
the <i>haute volée</i>. To-day I feel very much depressed.
Oh, this fog! Although the window at which I am
writing commands the same beautiful prospect with
which, as you will remember, Robert Bruce was so
delighted&mdash;Stirling Castle, mountains, lakes, a
charming park, in a word the most splendid view
in Scotland&mdash;I can see nothing except when the
sun breaks momentarily through the mist. If it
would but do this a little oftener! I shall soon
forget Polish, and speak French like an Englishman,
and English like a Scotchman.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If I do not write you a Jeremiade it is not
because I mistrust your sympathy, but because you
only know everything; and if I once begin I shall
go on complaining for ever, and always in the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
strain. But, no, I am wrong in saying it is always
the same, for I grow worse every day. I feel weaker
and weaker and cannot compose, not for want of
inclination, but from physical causes, and besides I
am in a different place every week. But what <i>am</i> I to
do? I must at least lay by something for the winter.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite the kindness and the hospitable welcome
which he received from two Scotch ladies, sisters,
one of whom, Miss J. W. Stirling, had been his
pupil, he did not enjoy his visit, and sometimes
longed for wings that he might fly back to France.
I quote again from his letter to Grzymala:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am quite incapable of doing anything all the
morning, and when I am dressed I feel so exhausted
that I am obliged to rest. After dinner I have to sit
two hours with the gentlemen, listen to their conversation,
and look on while they drink. I feel
ready to die with weariness, and think of other
things all the time till I go into the drawing-room,
when I have to use all my efforts to rouse myself,
for everybody is curious to hear me play. After this,
my good Daniel carries me upstairs, undresses and
puts me to bed; he leaves the light burning, and I
am once more at leisure to sigh and dream, and look
forward to passing another day in the same manner.
If I ever arrange to do anything I am sure to be
carried off in another direction, for my Scotch
friends&mdash;although with the best intentions in the
world&mdash;give me no rest. They want to introduce
me to all their relations; they will kill me with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
kindness, but for mere politenessʼ sake I must put up
with it all.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Witty men never quite lose their sense of humour,
and a gleam of cheerfulness, a spark of his former
brilliant <i>esprit</i>, would now and then shine forth amid
his melancholy. He describes going to the opera in
London when Jenny Lind made her <i>débût</i>, and the
Queen appeared in public for the first time after
a long retirement. He says, “I was very much
impressed, especially by old Wellington, who, as
a valiant protector of monarchy, sat in front of his
sovereign, like a faithful watch-dog guarding his
lordʼs castle. I have made the acquaintance of Jenny
Lind; she is from Sweden, and is quite an original.”</p>

<p>His <i>ennui</i>, however, increased. He wrote to
Grzymala:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I am going to Manchester where there is to be
a grand concert, and I am to play twice without
orchestral accompaniment. Alboni is also to perform,
but I take no interest in this or anything else.
I shall just sit down and play, and what I shall do
afterwards I do not yet know. If I were only sure of
not being ill if I spent the winter here.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In another letter he complains that he is feeling
ill, but has to play at a concert, and he commissions
his friend in Paris to look out for a suitable residence.
He adds, “why I should trouble you with
all this I do not know, for I really do not care about
anything. But I must think about myself, so I ask
you to help me in doing so.” Then comes a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
reference to the unhappy love which he cannot forget:
“I never yet cursed anyone, but I am now so overwhelmed
by the weariness of life, that I am ready to
<span class="sidenote">LAST LETTER FROM ENGLAND.</span>curse Lucrezia. But there is pain in this too, which
is all the worse as one grows older in wickedness
every day.” He finishes by saying, “It is no good
their troubling about me at home. I cannot be
more wretched than I am, and there is no chance of
my being less so. In general I feel nothing and await
my end with patience.” And indeed the end was not
far off. In his last letter from England he writes:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
“On Thursday I am to leave terrible London. In
addition to my other ills I have got neuralgia. Tell
Pleyel to send me in a piano on Thursday evening,
and have it covered; buy a bunch of violets to make
the room smell sweet.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> I should like when I return
to find some books of poetry in my bedroom to which
I shall, probably, be confined for some time. So on
Friday evening I hope to be in Paris; a day longer
here, and I should go mad or die. My Scotch lady
friends are good, but very wearisome. They have
made so much of me that I cannot easily get quit of
them. Let the house be thoroughly warmed and
well dusted. Perhaps I may get well again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This was, alas! a false hope. Chopin left London
in the beginning of 1849, after performing for the
last time at a concert he had got up for the benefit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>of the Polish emigrants, and which was very
numerously attended. Soon after his return to
Paris he suffered a severe loss in the sudden death
of the celebrated Dr. Molin, to whose skill and care
Chopin owed the prolongation of his life. From that
time he despaired of himself. The place of the
beloved and honoured physician, whose very presence
had been a comfort, could never be supplied.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">TOO ILL TO TRAVEL.</span>Hearing that his dear friend, Titus Woyciechowski,
was going to Ostend for the sea baths,
Frederic felt a strong desire to join him. Relative
to this we find two letters&mdash;the last he ever wrote.
As a Russian subject, it was not then very easy for
Woyciechowski to go to Paris. He would have
required special permission from the authorities at
Warsaw, or at least a letter from the Russian Ambassador
in Paris:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="right padr1"><i>Paris, August 20th, 1849.</i></p>
<p class="right"><i>Square dʼOrleans, Rue St. Lazare, No. 9.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,</p>

<p>
Nothing but my present severe illness should
prevent me from hastening to you at Ostend; but
I hope that by the goodness of God you may be
enabled to come to me. The doctors will not allow
me to travel. I am in my room drinking Pyrenean
water, but your presence would do me more good
than all the medicines.</p>

<p class="right padr2">Yours till death,</p>
<p class="right">FREDERIC.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span></p>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, September 12th, 1849.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Titus</span>,</p>

<p>I have not had time to see about obtaining the
permission for you to come here. I cannot go for it
myself, as I lie in bed half my time, but have asked
a friend, who has a good deal of influence, to see
about it for me, and shall hear something definite by
Sunday. I wanted to go by rail to the frontier at
Valenciennes to meet you; but the doctors forbid
my leaving Paris, because a few days ago I was not
able to get as far as Ville dʼAvraye, near Versailles,
where I have a god-son. For this reason they will
not send me to a warmer climate this winter.</p>

<p>You see it is only illness that keeps me; had I
been tolerably well I should certainly have gone to
Belgium to visit you. Perhaps you may be able to
come here. I am not egotistical enough to wish
that you should come merely for my sake; for, ill as
I am, you would be wearied and disappointed,
although I think we might pass some pleasant
hours, recalling youthful memories, and I wish the
time we do have together to be an entirely happy one.</p>

<p class="right padb1">Ever yours, FREDERIC.</p></blockquote>

<p>From that day the disease made rapid strides.
Chopin did not fear death, but seemed in a manner
to long for it. The thought of quitting a life so full
of sad remembrances was not altogether unwelcome.
His moments of respite from pain became fewer and
fewer. He spoke with perfect consciousness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
calmness about his death and the disposal of his
body. He expressed a wish to be buried in the
churchyard of Père Lachaise beside Bellini, with
whom between 1832 and 1835 he had been very
friendly.</p>

<p>He was so much worse by the beginning of October
that he could not sit up. His relatives were informed
of his condition, and Chopinʼs eldest sister, Madame
Louise Jedrzejewicz, immediately hastened to him
with her husband and daughter. The meeting
between brother and sister must be imagined rather
than described. In 1844 Louise had nursed her
beloved brother through a dangerous illness, and
afterwards spent a few weeks with him at
Nohant. She felt now directly she saw him that he
would only need her tender care a short time.
Sometimes, when free from pain, he was still cheerful
and hopeful. He even took a new house, No. 12,
Place Vendôme, and gave minute directions about
furnishing it.</p>

<p>At length the last hour approached. His sister
and his faithful pupil, Gutmann, never left him for
a moment. The Countess Delphine Potocka, who
was at some distance from Paris, set off to return the
instant she heard of the hopeless condition of the
revered master, that she might receive his farewell.
In the room adjoining the apartment where Chopin
lay speechless, were some friends anxious to see
him before he closed his eyes for ever. It was a
Sunday, the fifteenth of October, and the streets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
were quieter than usual. His sufferings were intense,
yet he tried to smile at the friends around him; and
when he saw the Countess Potocka, who was standing
beside his sister weeping bitterly, he asked her softly
to sing something. By a strong effort of self-control
she mastered her emotion, and in a ringing
voice of bell-like purity, sang Stradellaʼs Hymn to
the Virgin, so beautifully and so devoutly that the
dying man&mdash;artist and lover of the beautiful to the
very last&mdash;whispered with delight, “Oh how beautiful!
My God how beautiful! Again, again.” As if endowed
with supernatural strength the Countess sat down to
the piano and sang a psalm by Marcello. Those
standing at his bedside saw that he was growing
weaker every second and sank noiselessly on their
knees. The solemn stillness was broken only by
Delphine Potockaʼs wonderful voice, which sounded
like that of an angel summoning the great master to
the realms of the blessed; all suppressed their sobs
that they might not disturb the enjoyment of his
last moments.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS LAST HOURS.</span>
Evening was closing in; his sister knelt by his
bedside, weeping. The next morning Chopin felt a
little better. He asked for extreme unction, and
Alexander Jelowicki, a very pious and learned priest,
who was held in high esteem by his countrymen,
was sent for. The dying man confessed to him
twice, and, in the presence of his friends, received
the last sacrament. He then called them all one by
one to his bedside and blessed and commended them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
to God. After that he quite lost the power of speech
and seemed unconscious. But a few hours later he
revived and desired the priest to pray with him.
Resting his head on Gutmannʼs shoulder, Chopin, in
a clear voice repeated after the priest every word of
the Litany. When the last agony commenced he
said, “Who is near me?” Then he asked for some
water, and when he had moistened his lips he inclined
his head and kissed the hand of Gutmann,
who was supporting him. After this last sign of
gratitude and affection, he sighed once as if released
from a burden, and then closed his eyes for ever. At
this moment the bells of Paris struck three oʼclock in
the morning, of October 17th, 1849. A few minutes
afterwards the doors of the chamber were opened
and the friends and acquaintances in the next room
came to look once more on the beloved face of the
dead.</p>

<p>It was well known in musical circles that Chopin
dearly loved flowers and the very same morning
such quantities were sent that the body of the dead
but undying master as it lay in state was literally
covered with them. His face, which had been somewhat
changed by long illness, assumed an expression
of indescribable serenity and youthful loveliness.
M. Chesinger took a cast of his countenance, from
which he afterwards copied the marble bust which
adorns Chopinʼs tomb.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">FUNERAL SERVICE.</span>
The reverent admiration which Chopin had always
felt for Mozart led him to request, in his last days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
that no music but the German masterʼs sublime
Requiem should be performed at his funeral. Up till
1849 women had not been allowed to take part in
the musical performance at the Madeleine Church,
and special permission had to be obtained from the
ecclesiastical authorities. On this account the funeral
did not take place till October 30th. The first artists
in Paris co-operated. The funeral march from
Chopinʼs B flat minor Sonata, which had been scored
by Reber for the occasion, was introduced at the Introit.
For the Offertory, Lefébure Wély played on the
organ Chopinʼs Preludes in B minor and E minor.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>
The solos of the Requiem were rendered by Mesdames
Pauline Viardot-Garcia and Castellan, and the famous
bass singer, Lablache, who gave a splendid delivery of
the “Tuba mirum.” Meyerbeer conducted, and the
pall-bearers were Prince Alexander Czartoryski,
Delacroix, Franchomme and Gutmann.</p>

<p>When the remains were lowered into the grave,
Polish earth was scattered on the coffin. It was the
same that Chopin had brought from Wola nineteen
years before as a memorial of his beloved fatherland.
He had always guarded it with pious care,
and shortly before his death had requested that if he
might not rest in Polish soil his body might at least
be covered with his native earth. Chopinʼs heart,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>which had beaten so warmly and suffered so deeply
for his country was, according to his desire, sent to
the land whose sun had shone on his happy youth;
it is preserved <i>ad interim</i> in the church of the Sacred
Cross, at Warsaw.</p>

<p class="center padb1"><i>CHOPIN AS A MAN.</i></p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 32px;">
<img src="images/t.jpg" width="32" height="60" alt="T" /></span>O
 what has been written I have little to add.
Chopin was a model son, an affectionate brother,
and a faithful friend. His personal appearance
was so agreeable and harmonious that the eye
rested on him with pleasure. His dark brown eyes<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
were cheerful rather than pensive, his smile was
kindly and perfectly good-natured; he had a
complexion of almost transparent delicacy, and
luxuriant brown hair, as soft as silk; his Roman
nose was slightly aquiline; all his movements
were graceful, and he had the manners of an
aristocrat of the highest rank. Everyone with any
discernment of true gentility and real genius could
not but say, on seeing Chopin, “there is a distinguished
man.” His voice was musical and rather
subdued. He was not above middle height, naturally
delicate, and in his general contour resembled his
mother.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span></p>
<p>One of his lady friends not inaptly remarked that
“his disposition was joyous, but his heart full of
dreamy yearning,” which shows that by his good
spirits he diffused cheerfulness around him. Through
his nature there ran a vein of melancholy and
enthusiasm (schwärmerei) which was very attractive.
He had so much amiability and good-breeding, that
his physical sufferings, his nervous excitability, and
the violent antipathies which he felt in common with
all nervous people never, made any difference to his
behaviour in daily life. He rarely spoke about his
own feelings lest he should be misunderstood.</p>

<p>At some houses in Paris he was a daily guest, and
he always spent the evening with friends. Thus he
had the <i>entrée</i> of twenty or thirty <i>salons</i>, where he
met with universal kindness and attention, as everybody
was fascinated by him. To have transported
Frederic Chopin, the darling of princesses and
countesses, from these refined surroundings into a
simple common-place circle, would have been nothing
short of depriving him of the chief end of his
existence.</p>

<p>Unlike most great artists, he had an aversion to
appearing in public. To give a concert was to him
a disagreeable undertaking, which he never entered
on without repugnance. He had sufficient pride to
enable him to make a dignified appearance; he
knew, but did not over-estimate, his own powers,
and recognized with friendly fellow-feeling the artistic
merits of others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span></p>

<p>Accustomed to comfort and elegance, he liked to
be surrounded by <i>objets de luxe</i>, to have his apartments
richly carpeted, and filled with ornamental furniture,
costly consoles, and <i>étagères</i> covered with presents.
He was passionately fond of flowers, and, as I have
before mentioned, always had some in his rooms.
His dress was stylish and tasteful, and his linen
which came from the best shops in Paris, dazzlingly
white. He did not agree with those who say that
an artist has a right to neglect his appearance. It is
said that when he was going to play in public he
would order in coats from different tailors, and,
having tried them all on and found something to
object to in each, he would at the last moment
borrow one of his pupil, (Gutmann), which was a
great deal too large for him.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">HIS GENEROUS NATURE</span>
He used, especially when he first came to live
in France, to do all he could to help poor Polish
emigrants, either by recommendations or with money
and clothes. When Princess Czartoryska opened a
bazaar for their benefit at the Hotel Lambert, Chopin
spent more than a thousand francs in elegant trifles,
which he gave away. His generosity in this direction
knew no bounds, and it is not surprising that he left
nothing when he died. As a boy he had begun his
artistic career with a concert for the poor, and the
last he ever gave was for the Polish emigrants in
London. It was this ready sympathy that caused
the breach with Charles Lipinski, who came to Paris
in 1835, and gave some concerts. Chopin proposed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
that they should give a concert together for the
benefit of the Poles, but Lipinski refused, saying,
that he did not wish to compromise himself at St.
Petersburg, where he intended to perform next year.
Chopin was so indignant at this answer that he
broke off the friendship, and never forgave Lipinski
for his hard-hearted indifference towards his distressed
countrymen.</p>

<p>He was always willing to sacrifice himself for his
friends, but to strangers he was cool and reserved.
If he found people seeking his acquaintance and
sending him invitations for the sake of gaining distinction,
he soon put an end to the connection. When a
rich man, who had asked him to dinner that he
might amuse the guests by his playing, pressed him
to perform, Chopin replied, “Ah, sir, I have dined
so sparingly.” But when he was sure that he should
give real pleasure he was never stingy in exercising
his talents. The famous author, Louis Blanc, writes
in his “Histoire de la Revolution, 1848,” (vol. II.)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“When the republican, Gottfried Cavaignac (cousin
of the celebrated general) was approaching his end, he
expressed a wish to hear music once more. Louis
Blanc, who was personally acquainted with Chopin,
promised to go and find the artist, and bring him back
with him, if the doctor would consent. Chopin, being
informed by Louis Blanc of the circumstances, set off
at once. He was taken into a room with rather a bad
piano and sat down to play. Suddenly a loud sob was
heard. Moved and excited, Gottfried felt quickened with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
new life, and sat up, with his eyes full of tears. Chopin
was so much affected that he could not go on. Madame
Cavaignac bent anxiously over her son, who, mustering
up all his strength, said, in a weak voice, ‘Donʼt be
troubled, mother; it is nothing. Oh, what a beautiful
art is music! Such music and such playing!’”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="sidenote">DISLIKE TO CORRESPONDENCE.</span>
Frederic was in general not at all fond of letter-writing,
and needed some strong motive to induce
him to take up his pen. The only correspondence
he kept up was with his relations and his friend
Woyciechowski; and after 1838 this somewhat fell
off, his connection with the great French authoress
and his ill-health being probably the cause. He
dared not make known to his family the full particulars
of his manner of life, and knowing the strict
moral principles of his parents, he preferred to keep
secret his <i>liaison</i> with George Sand. This gave a
certain air of embarassment to his letters, which had
formerly been so open and unconstrained, that on
reading them one seemed both to see and hear him.</p>

<p>“It was often very comical,” says Liszt, “to see
Chopin receive a written invitation to dinner, which
he either wished or was obliged to decline; he would
take a long walk and excuse himself in person rather
than reply by writing.”</p>

<p>He often accompanied the letters to his sisters and
his nephews and nieces with playthings or articles of
dress, and was as delighted as a child if he could
prepare some surprise for them. It was a <i>fête</i> day
for him when a letter came from Warsaw. He never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
talked about it, but privately devoted his thoughts to
those he loved. He valued so highly any present
they sent him that he would not suffer any one to
touch it or even to look at it for long.</p>

<p>Brought up from a child in the faith of the Romish
Church he did not like to talk or argue about religion,
but kept his opinions to himself. He rarely took
any prominent part in discussions on politics or
literature, although he enjoyed listening to them.
He never obtruded his ideas on anyone, but if his
beloved art were attacked he was instantly up in
arms. In the cause of Romanticism he broke many
a lance, and gave abundant proof, particularly during
the first years of his residence in Paris, of his
thorough devotion to the principles of that school.
Its most important representatives at that time were
Berlioz and Liszt, the ablest, boldest, and most
persevering opponents of the Classic school. In 1832
Chopin, who had grown up amid the clamour of this
contest, adopted the views of Berlioz and Liszt, and
joined the party who openly discarded the old-fashioned
style, from which they held as much
aloof as from charlatanism. All through the controversy
over the Romantic school, some of the productions
of which were real masterpieces, Chopin remained
staunch to his opinions. He would not make
the slightest concession to those who did not follow
art for its own sake, but only used it as a means
of obtaining money, fame, or honour. Much
as he enjoyed the society of fellow artists, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
renounced it unhesitatingly if convinced that they
were going too far in their resistance to all innovation,
and were endeavouring to restrict his own
creative efforts. To him art was sacred, and he
would never praise a composition or an interpretation
which he did not think really worthy of being commended.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS CARE IN COMPOSITION.</span>
Chopin needed no recourse to artificial means to
secure the triumph and popularity of his works.
To his most intimate friends he would sometimes
say, “I believe that my works will stand on their
intrinsic merits; whether these be recognized now
or in the future is immaterial.” A thorough training
in youth, a habit of reflection, and his great reverence
for the beauties of the classics, effectually
preserved him from blindness and error. The extraordinary
care and conscientiousness with which
he finished his works protected him from the attacks
of those superficial or hostile critics who sought
eagerly for the smallest mistake. Early accustomed
to the sternest self-examination, he threw into his
waste-paper basket many compositions which others
would perhaps have proudly handed to their printer.
He never undertook a work unsuited to his capacities
or began anything which he was not sure he could
successfully carry out.</p>

<p>Educated by German masters and on German
principles, Chopin had a decided preference for the
music of that country. Handel, Gluck, Bach,
Haydn, and Mozart were his ideals of perfection;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
and although he felt the spell of Beethovenʼs genius,
he had less sympathy with its gigantic conceptions
than with the fascinating charm and lovely melodies
of Mozartʼs compositions. There seemed to him in
Beethovenʼs works a want of delicate finish, the proportions
were too colossal, and the storms of passion
too violent. About the year 1835, Schubert began
to be known in Paris, principally by his songs. Like
all impartial musicians, Chopin was charmed by
their wealth of melody; but he regretted that in his
larger works, the exuberance of the composerʼs fancy
frequently led him to overstep the limits of form, and
thus impair the effect.</p>

<p>When Chopin first began to attract the attention
of the musical world in Paris, there were odd stories
current about his parentage. Some thought he was
a German; others, on account of his name, a Frenchman.
He always protested energetically against these
suppositions, declaring, with the pride of a good
patriot, that he was a Pole. His nationality and
his love for his country were shown both in word
and deed, appearing not only in his generosity, and
his voluntarily sharing the exile of his unfortunate
countrymen, but also in his choice of friends and his
preference for Polish pupils. However, he was not at
all addicted to boasting of his patriotism. Although
of French descent on his fatherʼs side and perfectly
familiar with the language, his accent still betrayed
the nationality of his mother.</p>

<p>Just as he drew musical inspiration from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
Polish folk-songs, so he loved to imitate the simple
speech of the peasants, which he could render to
perfection in its crispness and terseness, if he were
in good spirits. When, for example, in a circle of
intimate friends his playing had created a melancholy
impression, he could at once disperse it by a counterfeit
of the peasant dialect, especially that of the
Mazovians and Cracovians. If a discussion arose as
to the comparative merits of the different modern
languages, he would always extol his mother tongue
to the skies, and could never say enough in praise of
its beauty, wealth, sweetness, aptness of expression,
and masculine power.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS SUPERSTITION.</span>
In common with many imaginative natures, Chopin
was, in a greater or less degree, according to his state
of health, very superstitious. Loitering along the
Boulevards, one evening after a <i>soirée</i>, in company
with some friends, among them A. Szmitkowski, to
whom he dedicated his glorious mazurkas, op. 59, he
was joking about his financial troubles. “I wish,”
he said, “that some good genius would put twenty
thousand francs into my desk. That would set me
up once for all, and I could indulge in the comfort I
am so fond of.” That night he dreamt that his
wish was realized. A few days after, on opening a
secret drawer of his desk in which he kept his money
and some much-prized memorials, he actually found
the desired sum. Miss Stirling, his pupil and devoted
follower, had given it to Szmitkowski to put there,
after having heard from him of Chopinʼs wish and
strange dream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span></p>

<p>Chopin had a dislike to the numbers seven and
thirteen; he would never undertake anything of
importance on a Monday or Friday, sharing a belief
almost universal in Poland that these are unlucky
days (ferelne.)</p>

<p>Devoted from childhood to his art, he lived constantly
in the tone-world, and when not listening to
music, he thought and dreamed of it. It is easy to
understand that incessant practice would irritate and
chafe his naturally susceptible nerves, and that his
feelings, fancies, and even his whole spiritual nature,
gradually grew into a state of etherial delicacy.
How painful, too, must have been the discord, when
he was brought into contact with rough reality. He
would then confide to his instrument his inmost
thoughts, which became more and more melancholy,
until at last his heart broke. Liszt says of Chopin,
“To the modern calm simplicity of devotion Chopin
united the reverent homage paid to art by the
early Mediæval masters. Like them he regarded
the exercise of his art as a high and holy calling, and
like them too he was proud of having been dedicated
by nature to be its priest, and he brought to its
service a pious worship which at once ennobles and
blesses the artist.” These feelings found expression
<span class="sidenote">AN OLD POLISH CUSTOM.</span>
even in his last hours, as a reference to Polish
customs will explain. It is still a practice, though
less common than formerly, for the dying person to
choose the clothes for his burial; many, indeed,
have them prepared long beforehand. Thus are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
revealed the most secret and cherished thoughts,
and by worldly but believing people the garments of
the cloister are often selected for their last dress,
especially by women. Men are more generally
buried in their uniform with their arms laid beside
them.</p>

<p>Chopin, although not only a composer, but one of
the greatest of pianists (the first of his day as many
think) gave proportionately the fewest concerts; yet
he wished to be laid in the grave in the clothes he
had worn on those occasions. A deep feeling, springing
from the inexhaustible fountain of his artistic
enthusiasm, doubtless prompted this last desire. It
was fulfilled. As he lay covered with flowers and
palm branches in the familiar dress, the admirers
who surrounded his coffin could but exclaim, Frederic
Chopin remained true to himself, for his last thoughts
were of his art.</p>

<p>Banished from his home by political events,
separated from his family, led into the thorny paths
of unhappy love, bowed down by illness, his life was
brought to an early close, but in his sublime creations
he has left us a portion of his own rich spirit.</p>

<p><span class="figleft" style="width: 43px;">
<img src="images/a.jpg" width="43" height="60" alt="I" /></span>S a creative artist, Chopin holds a unique position.
Confining himself to the comparatively restricted
limits of a single instrument, it is, in the
opinion of competent judges, his especial merit to
have been not only a thoroughly scientific musician,
but also a true poet, whose productions have had the
most wide-spread influence on all modern pianoforte
composers, an influence not unlike that of
Heine in the domain of poetry. Poet and musician
alike give us the most perfect emotional pictures in
the smallest forms, but with this difference, that
while Heineʼs scepticism had a blighting effect on
these miniatures, Chopinʼs harmonious disposition
was a fructifying energy. How strongly convinced
must Chopin have been that his special mission was
the embellishment of pianoforte literature, to be able
to resist the tempting and seemingly effective help of
an orchestra, and to voluntarily restrict himself to
one instrument, for which he wrote masterpieces,
of their kind incomparable. Liszt justly observes,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<span class="sidenote">LARGE AND SMALL ART FORMS.</span>We are too much accustomed at the present day to
consider great only those composers who have written
at least half a dozen Operas and Oratorios, besides
Symphonies; demanding, in our folly, everything and
more than everything of one musician. However
universal this idea may be, its reasonableness is very
problematical. We have no wish to contest the hardly
won glory or the real superiority of the composers who
have adopted the largest forms; all we desire is that, in
music, size should be estimated in the same way as
in the other arts: a painting, such as the ‘Vision of
Ezekiel,’ or ‘The Churchyard,’ by Ruysdaël, twenty
inches square, is placed among the chefs-dʼœuvre, and
ranks higher than many larger pictures by a Rubens or
a Tintoretto. Is Beranger less of a poet because he
poured all his thoughts into the narrow limits of a song?
Is not Petrarch known chiefly by his sonnets? How
many of his readers are acquainted with his poem
on Africa? We cannot but believe that the criticism
which denies the superiority of an artist like Schubert
over one who occupies himself in scoring tame operatic
melodies, will disappear; and that, henceforth, we shall
consider the quality of the expression whatever may be
the size of the form chosen for its vehicle.”</p></blockquote>

<p>To give a competent analysis of Chopinʼs works
(a list of which with the opus numbers appears at
the end of this book) would require a volume to
itself. I must, therefore, be content with a general
survey of his compositions, enlarging more fully on
that species whose origin or, at least, whose high
development, we owe to his genius.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span></p>

<p>The human mind is subject to two kinds of influence&mdash;internal
and external. The former are
determined by natural disposition, the latter by
family and national associations. From their union
proceeds the individuality of the man who is subject
to their ever present forces. Individuality can
neither protect its works from influences nor change
its own nature, because even if it adopts another
course, though the result may be a very perfect
organization, the traces of earlier impressions can
never be obliterated.</p>

<p>It is interesting to watch the growth and development
of Chopinʼs talents in relation to the different
schools. Although under the influence of none in
particular, and not following the guide of any of the
leading spirits of the day, he showed a slight and
brief preference for Hummel, whom he took as a
model, especially with regard to his passage work.
We can trace this master in the form of most of
Chopinʼs works, while from beginning to end there is
an individuality in the choice of thoughts. The
leaning to Hummel is chiefly discernible in his
rondos; but in the “Don Juan” variations and
the fantasia on Polish airs, that boldness and freshness
of thought, independence of working, and
originality of conception, which at once gave him
a prominent position among contemporary composers,
are already apparent. His lavish display of
sentiment, youthful grace and energy, hopefulness
and melancholy, show how unquenchable were the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
springs of his genius. Indeed so vast was the wealth
of his ideas that, as was remarked in referring to his
early works, he never repeated the same thought in
the same manner, but either by the most tasteful
arabesques, or choice changes of harmony, imparted
to it at every return a renewed interest. He was
very clever in turning to account all the embellishments
and <i>fioritures</i> characteristic of the old Italian
style of vocal music.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS EARLY WORKS.</span>
Chopinʼs earliest works are undoubtedly the result
of the musical tendencies of the age; traditional
forms opened to him the gates of the temple where
the greatest masters of pianoforte playing sit enthroned.
But into these forms he infused his own
creative talent. Chopinʼs imagination struck deeper
chords than that of other composers; he inaugurated
a new era (as he himself wrote to Elsner) and cut a
way for himself, not for the sake of surpassing
others, but by the unconscious impulse of his own
original thoughts. In his youthful years he occasionally
availed himself of the resources of the orchestra;
but never afterwards except for the Polonaise, op. 22,
that brilliant piece which, although in E flat major
throughout, begins with a marvellously tender and
imaginative introduction in G major. In the orchestral
colouring a certain timidity is frequently
perceptible, owing, perhaps, to an ignorance of the
capacities of the different instruments. He showed
a preference for the violoncello; its elegiac tone was
in harmony with his own nature. Besides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
Polonaise, op. 3, he also composed, with Franchomme,
a duet, for piano and ʼcello, on motives
from “Robert le Diable” (a work without any
special merit, written in accordance with the taste
of the day), and shortly before his death, the Sonata
in G minor, op. 65, the first movement of which is of
surpassing beauty.</p>

<p>Among the works for piano alone, the Sonatas, as
being his largest compositions, claim our first attention.
The earliest published, as op. 4, dedicated to
Elsner, shows a striving after classic forms, but
does not give us the idea that the composer was
working from inspiration, his wishes and capacities
do not seem always to correspond, and the work
altogether awakens no lasting interest. The third
movement is most worthy of notice, but this does
not satisfy us completely; it sounds rather forced
and laboured, probably on account of the unusual
5/4 measure. Incomparably more important is the
Sonata in B flat minor, op. 35. The anxious character
of the first theme is happily contrasted with
the exuberant song of the second motive; and the
Funeral March could only have been written by one
in whose soul the pain and mourning of a whole
nation found its echo.</p>

<p>The more dramatic Sonata, in B minor, op. 58, is
better adapted by the brilliancy of its ornamentation
for a concert performance. The composer seems to
have found it difficult to keep the profusion of
thought within due proportions, especially in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
Adagio. In the development of the first theme in
the first movement, there is a want of repose which
is only made up for by the wonderful <i>cantilene</i> in D
major. Chopin is generally less successful when
writing in stricter forms which hamper the bold
flight of his fancy. His inventive power and melodic
wealth were so abundant that it was irksome to him
to work out his themes systematically; and his
Sonatas, therefore, with respect to form, sometimes
appear unfinished; while in more congenial spheres
he could permit his rich imagination to have freer
play.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS MAZURKAS.</span>
Chopin was very partial to the dance forms&mdash;mazurka,
polonaise, waltz, tarantelle, cracovienne,
and bolero&mdash;which he first truly idealized. Out of
the large number of his mazurkas it is difficult to
tell to which to award the palm; so wide a scope do
they offer for individual taste. Among the best&mdash;which,
by their gay or melancholy character, appear
so diverse but are all alike characterized by the
same rhythm&mdash;must undoubtedly be reckoned, op. 7,
Nos. 2. and 3; op. 17, Nos. 1 and 2; op. 24, No. 2;
op. 30, No. 3; op. 33, No. 4, The mazurkas, op.
24, No. 4; op. 50, No. 3; op. 63, No. 3, distinguished
by poetical charm and contrapuntal skill,
are worthy of mention. Some of those mazurkas
are almost more effective which display a tinge of
melancholy, as if the composer had only indulged
in a momentary diversion and narcotic intoxication
to return the more sadly to his original gloom. The
most striking mazurka of this class is op. 56, No. 2.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span></p>

<p>Tradition assigns to the polonaise the following
origin. When the dynasty of the Jagiellons died
out, Henry of Anjou, son of Catherine de Medicis,
afterwards Henry III., was, in 1573, elected King of
Poland. The following year he received the representatives
of the nation in solemn state at Cracow
Castle; and the gentlemen made their wives slowly
defile before the king, keeping step to an accompaniment
of music. Every time a foreign prince was
elected to the throne this ceremony was repeated,
and from it was gradually developed the national
dance of the polonaise, which has kept its place
in Europe up to the present day. In the slow
sweeping measure of the polonaise there is much
stateliness and gravity, and the turnings and
changes seem like the echo of the murmurs from
the active life of the old Polish nobility. It used
always to be danced with the sabre called “Carabella.”
Prince Michael Oginski and afterwards
Kurpinski were the first to treat it artistically, a
circumstance which contributed in some measure
to their reputation; after them, non-Polish composers,
such as Beethoven, Schubert, Weber, Spohr,
&amp;c., made it into an independent musical form, and
wrote works on the model of the polonaise; until
Chopin ennobled it with his own poetry and ideal
beauty, and once more infused into it a distinctively
Polish cast of thought.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS POLONAISES.</span>
Chopinʼs polonaises may be divided into two
groups: the one with its marked rhythm, displaying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
the martial element; the other the dreamy melancholy
feeling peculiar to Chopin. To the first order
I should assign the polonaises in A major, op. 40,
No. 1; F sharp minor, op. 44; and A flat major,
op. 53. For simplicity of form and characteristic
nationality the preference must be given to the
polonaise in A major; although technically inferior
and deficient in poetry&mdash;for it is <i>forte</i> almost throughout,
and the themes are not well contrasted&mdash;it is
effective on account of its chivalric ring and natural
dignity. The grandest and boldest is undoubtedly
the F sharp minor polonaise, dedicated to Princess
Beauvau, sister to Countess Delphine Potocka.
The gloomy colouring and wildly defiant character
of the chief theme are suddenly interrupted by a
charming <i>intermezzo</i> in the mazurka style. Almost
equally marvellous is the dreamy <i>finale</i>, in which,
while the right hand holds the C sharp&mdash;to which
the semitone D immediately falls like a heavy
<i>appoggiatura</i>&mdash;in the left hand the energetic theme
dies away to the gentlest <i>pianissimo</i>. The majestic
A flat major polonaise was composed in 1840 after
Chopinʼs return from Majorca.</p>

<p>Chopinʼs nervous system was so much affected by
his illness that, for sometime afterwards, his restless
imagination would not permit him to sleep. One
night, while playing a work he had just finished, he
fancied that the doors opened, and that a great company
of Polish knights and noble ladies in the old
costume (robe ronde et cornettes) came in and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
marched past him. He was so much perturbed
by this vision that he rushed out through the opposite
door and would not return to his room for the rest
of the night. Indeed the middle movement in E
major, with the long crescendo in the bass, so
vividly conjures up an approaching band of knights,
galloping over a plain in the pale light of the moon,
that one hears in fancy the tramp of the fiery steeds
and the clatter of arms.</p>

<p>The second group comprises the polonaises in
C sharp and E flat minor, op. 26; the polonaise
in C minor, op. 40, No. 2; and three in D minor,
B flat major, and F minor, op. 71, published by
Fontana. The two first, dedicated to J. Dessauer,
are pre-eminent for loftiness of sentiment. They
were composed at a time when Chopin was at the
summit of his greatness, when his vigorous and
original mind, unhampered by trivial considerations
about form, created for itself the form best adapted
to its conceptions. For example, the first polonaise
(C sharp minor) not only has a melody of uncommon
beauty, but there is also a rare depth of character
in the apparently bold incoherent themes with
which the work begins. While the grand rhythmical
swing of the first theme depicts manly courage,
which is tempered by an erotic love theme, the
second subject, with the exception of the lightning-like
passages in the right hand, is of a hopeful,
soothing character; the D flat major motive closes
the happy scene. None of the later polonaises<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
contain a double motion of the melody, as we find
in the conclusion of this. The second number
of the same opus (E flat minor) is mysterious,
gloomy, and shuddering; it seems to picture the
suffering Poles banished in chains to Siberia.</p>

<p>The Fantasie-polonaise in A flat major, op. 61,
holds a position distinct from either of these groups.
It is intended to represent the national struggles
and contests, and concludes, therefore, with a pompous
hymn of victory. Chopinʼs firm belief in the
ultimate triumph of the Polish nation after its
many bitter trials&mdash;a feeling so well depicted in
the poetry of Mickiewicz, Krasinski, and frequently
of Slowacki, the greatest poets of that period&mdash;speaks
out very clearly in this the most finished
of his larger pianoforte works.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">ROMANTIC NATURE OF HIS MUSIC.</span>
It would be foolish to seek in Music for allegory,
history, politics, or philosophical deductions. The
sphere of music is feeling, through which and to
which it speaks, and through feeling unites itself
with the poetry of the present day, not only by
a common national sentiment, but in nearly all
its tones and <i>nuances</i>. Chopinʼs music is like poetry,
a flower of Romanticism, and it has the same
beauties and the same defects as our romantic
poetry. It touches the highest and deepest springs
of emotion, is original, rich in thoughts and forms;
but it suffers from the same exaggerated sentiment
and melancholy, and frequently degenerates into
nervous debility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span></p>

<p>Chopinʼs waltzes (op. 18, 34, 42, 64, 69, and 70),
partly because they are the least technically difficult,
partly on account of the popularity of this dance
form, have become most widely known. Musically
considered, they offer less of interest and novelty
than his other compositions. What they lose in the
rhythm of the dance they gain in innate grace and
outward brilliancy, such as no composer hitherto
had been able to impart to this form. The most
interesting are those which are pervaded by that
peculiar melancholy, “schwärmerisch” vein, which
is one of the chief charms of Chopinʼs muse. Such
are the waltzes in A minor and C sharp minor,
the latter inclining in the third and fourth bar to
the mazurka measure, for which Chopin always
showed a preference.</p>

<p>The four ballads (op. 23, 38, 47, and 52), are
among the finest and most original of his works.
They contain so much that is new and varied in
form that critics long hesitated to what category
they should assign them. Some regarded them as
a variety of the rondo; others, with more accuracy,
called them “poetical stories.” Indeed, there is
about them a narrative tone (märchenton) which
is particularly well rendered by the 6/4 and 6/8 time,
and which makes them differ essentially from the
existing forms. Chopin himself said to Schumann,
on the occasion of their meeting at Leipsic, that
he had been incited to the creation of the ballads
by some poems of Mickiewicz. The first and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
perhaps the best known in G minor, op. 23, is
inflamed by wild passion, and claims special admiration
for its finish of detail, the second and third
have a predominantly idyllic character. The fourth,
and technically the most difficult, is, perhaps, for
this reason the least known. The critics who, with
the exception of Robert Schumann, unanimously
condemned Chopinʼs larger works, made a fierce
onslaught on this ballad. But, in my opinion,
this displays the most poetry and intelligence of
them all; and, for a satisfactory interpretation of
its manifold beauties, not only considerable mechanical
skill, but also subtle musical perception are
required.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS NOCTURNES.</span>
The nocturnes appear, at first sight, to have most
affinity with forms already created. Field, for a
long time erroneously looked upon as Chopinʼs
master, was the author of this form; but the
difference of treatment by the two masters is apparent
in its very likeness. Field was satisfied with
writing tender, poetical, and rather melancholy
pieces; while Chopin not only introduced the
dramatic element, but displayed, in a striking
manner, a marvellous enrichment of harmony and
of the resources of pianoforte composition. Compare,
for example, Chopinʼs E flat major nocturne,
op. 9, with Fieldʼs, in B flat major, and the broad
difference is at once perceived. Among Chopinʼs
best productions of this kind are the nocturne,
op. 15, No. 2 (in doppio movimento); the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
beautiful D flat major nocturne, op. 27, with its
profusion of delicate <i>fioritures</i>; and also the one in
G minor, op. 37, which keeps up a ceaseless moan,
as if harping on some sad thought, until interrupted
by a church-like movement in chords whose sadly
comforting strains resemble the peacefulness of the
grave. The following nocturne, op. 37, No. 2,
contains in the middle movement, perhaps the most
beautiful melody Chopin ever wrote, to which one
can never listen without a sense of the deepest
emotion and happiness. Op. 48, No. 1, in C minor,
is broad and most imposing with its powerful intermediate
movement, which is a thorough departure from
the nocturne style. The nocturne, published posthumously
as op. 72, was written in 1827, and bears
evident traces of that youthful period; op. 62, No. 2,
in E major, was written shortly before Chopinʼs
death, and is full of refinements of harmony, sweet
melody, and reverie.</p>

<p>Almost the same thing may be said of the scherzi
as of the ballads: they did not exist before Chopin,
or at least not in the same measure of independence,
daring boldness, and almost Shaksperian humour.
In the most well-known of these in B flat minor,
op. 31, the first theme is obstinately gloomy, yet not
despondent but defiant; and scarcely less fine is
the clever and expressive second subject in A major.
To appreciate to the full Chopinʼs creative powers
his pianoforte pieces must be compared with those of
his contemporaries, for the scherzi still appear so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
modern that it might well be said they were thirty
years in advance of their time.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">THE SCHERZI AND PRELUDES.</span>
In demonianism and drastic power the B flat
minor scherzo, op. 31, resembles those in B minor,
op. 20, and in C sharp minor, op. 39; while the one
in E minor, op. 54, presents a kindlier face. The
rhythm of the scherzi, far more than of the mazurkas,
expresses a certain spirited opposition, a fascinating
arrogance; and as the dance forms to which the
mazurkas and polonaises in part still belonged were
completely destroyed by the middle theme, the
specimens of the scherzo may be regarded as a
wonderfully true expression of Chopinʼs courageous
individuality, decisive both outwardly and inwardly,
noble, amiable, and poetic.</p>

<p>The preludes (op. 28 and 45) and the four impromptus
(op. 29, 36, 51, and 66) show a slight
leaning towards the nocturnes&mdash;as, for example, the
unhappily little known but richly modulated prelude
in C sharp minor, op. 45; also the D flat major, op.
28, No. 15, with a splendid middle movement in
C sharp minor, and the impromptu in F sharp major,
op. 36&mdash;and partake partly of the nature of a study&mdash;as,
for example, the impromptus in A flat major
and G flat major, with their melodious middle movements;
and the preludes, op. 28, Nos. 1, 3, 8, 16,
19, and 23&mdash;and are also in part hasty sketches
in which the composer, in spite of the smallness of
their dimensions, gives us the most clever imaginative
pictures. Some of them&mdash;such as those in E<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
minor and B minor&mdash;are real gems, and would alone
suffice to immortalize the name of Chopin as a poet.</p>

<p>Chopin deserves especial honour for having perfected
the study. Some of his studies (op. 10, 25,
and “Trois Nouvelles Etudes,”) serve purely technical
purposes, such as op. 10, Nos. 1, 2, 4, 8; op. 25,
Nos. 6, 8, and No. 3 of the “Trois Nouvelles
Etudes;” others are important intellectually, such
as op. 10, Nos. 3, 9, 10, 12; op. 25, Nos. 1 and 7;
and No. 1 of the “Etudes.”</p>

<p>The works which Fontana published at Schlesingerʼs
after Chopinʼs death&mdash;Fantasie-impromptu,
op. 66: quatre mazurkas, op. 67; quatre mazurkas,
op. 68; deux valses, op. 69; trois valses, op. 70;
trois polonaises, op. 71; nocturne, marche funèbre,
trois ecossaises, op. 72; rondeau pour deux pianos,
op. 73; sixteen Polish songs, op. 74&mdash;are, with the
exception of a few such, as op. 66, which are well
worthy of the name of their composer, of less musical
value. Chopin wished them to be destroyed after
his death, or at least not published. The last
mazurka, <i>senza fine</i>, composed a few days before he
died, is sad, very sad, like the last days of the great
master. He showed by this swan-song and by his
yearning after the home of his happy youth, that in
the very last hour of his creative inspiration he remained
faithful to his national music and to his
sorely-tried fatherland.</p>

<p><span class="sidenote">CHOPINʼS POLISH SONGS.</span>
The sixteen Polish songs were written without any
titles. If he met with any new and beautiful poetry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
in his native tongue, he would set it to music, not
for publication but for his own pleasure. Thus
these songs gradually accumulated between 1824 and
1844. Many have been lost because, in spite of the
requests of his friends, the composer constantly put
off committing them to paper; others were sung in
Poland without anything positive being known as to
their origin, but it is pretty certainly conjectured
that Chopin was their composer. Among these
must be mentioned the popular and formerly much
sung “The third of May.”</p>

<p>Unimportant in a musical point of view, it could
not be expected that they would be diffused beyond
the confines of Poland. They sprang from the seed
of the later national poetical growth, scattered as
if by accident on Chopinʼs receptive soul; they
are simple flowers which do not dazzle, but by their
sweet perfume and peculiar delicacy delight sympathetic
hearts.</p>

SUBJOIN a few letters written by Chopin
between 1828 and 1831 to his friend Titus
Woyciechowski, which I did not think it necessary
to insert in the biography:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="center">I.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, Saturday, December 27th, 1828.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dearest Friend</span>,
</p>

<p>Hitherto I have delayed writing to you, but now
friendship triumphs over idleness, and, sleepy as I am, I
take up my pen that you may have this in time for the
1st and the 4th of January. I do not desire to fill my
letter with compliments, good wishes, or trite jokes, for
we both understand each other perfectly&mdash;whence my
silence and the laconic nature of this epistle....</p>

<p>The score of my Rondo Cracovienne is ready. The
introduction is almost as funny as I am in my great coat,<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>and the trio is not quite finished. My parents have just
had fitted up for me a little room, leading by a staircase
direct from the <i>entrée</i>; there will be an old <i>secrétaire</i> in
it, and I shall make it my den. That orphan child, the
Rondo for two pianos, has found a step-father in Fontana,
(whom you may, perhaps, have seen here; he
goes to the University); he has learnt it after a monthʼs
study, and, a short time ago, we tried it over at Buchholtzʼs
to see how it might sound. I say “might,”
for the instruments were not tuned alike, and our fingers
were stiff, so we could have no adequate impression of
the effect of the work. For a week past I have composed
nothing of any value. I run from Ananias to
Caiaphas; this evening I was at Madame Wizegerodʼs,
and from there went to a musical <i>soirée</i> at Mlle. Kickaʼs.
You know how pleasant it is to be pressed to improvise
when you are tired. I seldom now have such happy
thoughts as when you were with me. And then the
wretched instruments one finds everywhere. I have not
found one either in mechanism or tone anything approaching
ours or your sisterʼs.</p>

<p>The Polish theatre opened yesterday with “Preciosa.”
The French have given “Rataplan;” to-day, the “Geldhab,”
by Fredro; and to-morrow, Auberʼs “Maurer und
Schlosser” are to be performed. Somebody or other
said to me the other day that you had written to him. Do
not think I am angry with you for not having written to
me for so long; I know you well enough, and do not think
anything of a bit of paper; I should not have scribbled
so much nonsense to-day, but to remind you that you
still hold the same place in my heart, and that I am
the same Fritz as ever. You do not like being kissed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
but you must put up with it to-day. We all unite

<p class="center">II.</p>

<p class="center"><i>Warsaw, April 10th, 1830.</i></p>

<p class="right">(<i>Anniversary of Emilyʼs death.</i>)</p>

<p>I have been vainly wishing to write to you for some
weeks past. I donʼt know why the time should pass so
quickly now. Our musical season is at its height,
Passion week even was disregarded. Last Monday
there was a grand <i>soirée</i> at Philippeusʼs, when Madame
Saurin sang a duet from “Semiramis” very beautifully;
I accompanied Messrs. Soliva and Gresser in a Buffo
Duet from Rossiniʼs “Turk in Italy,” which, by unanimous
desire, was repeated. I have sketched out a
programme of the <i>soirée</i> at Lewickiʼs, at which Prince
Galizin is to take part in a quartet by Rode. I shall
select Hummelʼs “La Sentinelle,” and shall finish with
my polonaise with violoncello, to which I have written
an Adagio by way of introduction. I have tried it
already, it does not go badly. This is the latest <i>salon</i>
news, and now for the newspaper intelligence, which is
no less important to me, as it includes some most
favourable opinions about myself. I should like to send
them to you. There was an article, two pages long, in
the <i>Warsaw Gazette</i>, in which Elsner was very much
abused. Soliva told me that he only avoided the controversy
because two of his pupils were shortly to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>a public appearance, otherwise he should certainly have
replied to the attack. It is difficult to describe the
whole case in a few words; I would send you the newspaper
if I could, so as to make the matter quite clear.
A word to the wise is sufficient, so I will give a brief
outline of the affair.</p>

<p>My concerts called forth a great many laudatory
notices, especially in the <i>Polish Courier</i>, and the
<i>Official Journal</i> also gave me a few words of praise.
This was all very well, but one of the numbers of the
latter newspaper, although in perfect good faith, was full
of such absurdities that I felt quite in despair until I
read in the <i>Gazette Polska</i> a refutation of the exaggerated
statements in the <i>Official Journal</i>. This paper was mad
enough to say that Poland would one day be as proud of
me as Germany is of Mozart; and that “if I had fallen
into the hands of a pedant or a Rossinist (what a
ridiculous expression!) I should never have been what
I am.” Although, indeed, I am nothing yet, the critic
is so far right in saying that if I had not studied
with Elsner, I should have done still less. This taunt
at a Rossinist, and praise of Elsner made somebody
so angry<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> that, in an article in the <i>Warsaw Gazette</i>,
beginning with Fredroʼs comedy, “Die Freunde,” and
ending with “Grafen Ory,” there was the following
paragraph: “Why should any gratitude be due to
Elsner? he does not make pupils off hand,” and (at my
second concert Nowakowskiʼs symphony was performed)
“the Devil even cannot make something out of nothing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span></p>

<p>Thirty-five years ago Elsner wrote a quartet, to which
the publisher, without the authorʼs knowledge, appended
the title “Dans le meilleur gout polonais,” on account of
the Polish character of the Menuet. The present
reviewer, without mentioning the composerʼs name,
ridicules this quartet. Soliva says truly that they would
have been just as much justified in abusing “Caecilia,”<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
especially as, with all kindness and delicacy, they give
me some side thrusts, and the good piece of advice that
I should listen to Rossini but not copy him. No doubt
this was said because the other article remarked that I
had a great deal of originality.</p>

<p>I am invited to an Easter breakfast at Minasowiczʼs<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>
for the day after to-morrow; Kurpinski is to be there,
and I am very curious to see how he will behave towards
me. You would not believe how amiable he always is
to me. I saw him last Wednesday week at little Leskiewiczʼs
concert. The latter does not play badly, although
he still shows that he is a learner. It seems to me that
he will be a better player than Krogulski, but I have not
yet ventured to say so, though I have been often asked
for an opinion.</p>

<p>Oh! the postman! A letter ... from you!
Oh, my dear friend, how good you are! It is no wonder,
however, for I am always thinking of you. As far as I
can gather from your letter, you have only seen the
<i>Warsaw Courier</i>; get the <i>Polish Courier</i>, and No. 91 of
the <i>Warsaw Gazette</i>, if you can. Your advice is good;
I had already given up some invitations for the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>as if in anticipation of it, for I always think a great deal
of you in everything that I undertake. I do not know
whether it is because I have learnt to think and feel with
you, but when I write anything I always want to know
if it pleases you, and my second concerto (E minor) will
not have any value in my eyes until you have heard and
approved it.</p>

<p>My third concert, which is being counted on here,
will not take place until shortly before I leave; I
think of playing the new Concerto, which is not yet
finished, then, by desire, the Fantasia on Polish airs,
and the Variations dedicated to you, which I am
anxiously awaiting, as the Leipsic fair has already
begun, and Brzezina has received a large consignment
of music. The Frenchman from St. Petersburg, who
wanted to treat me with champagne after my second
concert, and whom people took for Field, is a pupil
from the Paris Conservatoire, named Dunst. He has
given several concerts in St. Petersburg, which made
a great sensation, so he must play unusually well.
You will, doubtless, think it strange, a Frenchman
from St. Petersburg with a German name. I have the
sad piece of news to add that Orlowski has been making
mazurkas and galops on my themes; but I have begged
him not to have them printed.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, April 17th, 1830.</i></p>
<p class="right padr1">(<i>Papaʼs birth-day.</i>)</p>

<p>A letter from you gives me some respite from my
unendurable yearning (sehnsucht), and to-day I was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
more than ever in need of this consolation. I want
to drive away the thoughts which poison my happiness;
yet it gives me pleasure to dally with them; I do not
know what ails me ... perhaps I shall be calmer by
the end of this letter.</p>

<p>I am very pleased to hear that there is some probability
of your coming, for I am going to remain until
the meeting of the Diet, which, as you have doubtless
seen by the newspapers, will take place on the 28th inst.,
and last a month. The <i>Warsaw Courier</i> has already
announced the arrival of M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntag; Dmuszewski,
the editor, is incorrigible, he is always getting hold
of some story, which he prefixes by saying, “We learn,
on good authority,” &amp;c., &amp;c. When I met him yesterday
he told me that he was going to insert a sonnet addressed
to me. I begged him, for heavenʼs sake, not to do anything
so absurd. “It is already printed,” he replied,
with a smile, thinking that I should feel very much
delighted and honoured. Oh, these mistaken favours!
Those who envy me will have another mark to shoot
at. With regard to the mazurkas on themes from my
Concerto, mercenary motives have won the day, and
they are already published. I do not care to read
anything more that people may write about me.</p>

<p>Last week I had an idea of coming to see you, but
was too busy; I must work as hard as I can to finish
my compositions. If you come to Warsaw for the
meeting of the Diet, you will be at my concert. I have
a presentiment that you will, and if I dream that you do,
I shall firmly believe it.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> How often do I turn night
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>into day, and day into night; how often do I wake in
dreams, and sleep in the day; but it is not like sleep, for
I always feel the same, and instead of gaining refreshment,
I worry myself, and rack my brains, till I am quite
exhausted.</p>

<p>Pray think kindly of me ...</p>

<hr />
<p class="center">IV.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, June 5th, 1830.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,</p>

<p>You have missed five of M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntagʼs concerts,
but if you come on the 13th, you will have several
opportunities of hearing her. The 13th will be Sunday,
and you will arrive just when I am at home, trying over
the Allegro of the Second Concerto, as I am making all
the use I can of M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntagʼs absence. I learnt from
her own pretty lips that she was going to Fischbach,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> by
invitation from the King of Prussia, and that she would
return from there to us.</p>

<p>I cannot tell you what pleasure I have received from
closer acquaintance with this “heavenly messenger,” as
some enthusiasts justly call her; I am sincerely grateful
to Prince Anton Radziwill for having introduced me. I,
unfortunately, got but little benefit from her weekʼs stay
here, for she was bored with wearisome visits from
senators, Woiewodes, castellans, ministers, generals,
and adjutants, who sat staring at her and making dull
speeches. She received them all very kindly, for she is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>too good-hearted to be ever unamiable. Yesterday,
when she wanted to go out to a rehearsal, she was
actually obliged to shut herself up in her room, as the
servant could not keep the hosts of callers out of the
ante-room. I should not have gone to her had she not
sent for me, on account of Radziwill having asked me to
write out a song he had arranged for her. It consists of
variations on an Ukrainian folk-song (Dumka); the theme
and the <i>finale</i> are pretty, but I do not at all like the middle
movement, and M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntag approves of it still less; I
have made some alterations, but it wonʼt do yet. I am
glad that she is going after to-dayʼs concert, as I shall
thus be released from this trouble, and when Radziwill
comes back for the close of the Diet, he will, perhaps,
have given up his variations.</p>

<p>M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntag is not beautiful, but extremely fascinating;
everyone is enchanted with her voice, which is
not particularly powerful, but splendidly cultivated. Her
<i>diminuendo</i> is the <i>non plus ultra</i>, her <i>portamento</i> wonderfully
beautiful, and her chromatic scales, in the
upper register especially, unequalled. She sang us
an air by Mercadente very beautifully, and Rodeʼs
variations, especially the last <i>roulades</i>, more than
excellently. The variations on a Swiss theme were
so much liked that she was obliged, after repeatedly
bowing her acknowledgments, to sing them <i>da capo</i>;
and the same thing occurred yesterday after the last
variation by Rode. She sang also the Cavatina from
the “Barbier,” and some airs from the “Diebischen
Elster” and the “Freischütz.” But soon you will be able
to judge for yourself of the difference between her
performances and anything that we have heard here
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>before. One day when I was with her, Soliva brought
M<sup>lles</sup>. Gladkowska and Wolkow to sing to her their duet,
closing with the words “barbara sorte” (you remember
it, do you not?) M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntag said to me, in confidence,
that both voices were very beautiful, but rather screamy,
and that the young ladies must change their method
of singing altogether, unless they wanted to run the
risk of losing their voices completely in two years.
I heard her say to M<sup>lle</sup>. Wolkow that she sang with a
great deal of ease and taste, but had “une voix trop
aigue.” She invited them both in the kindest manner
to come and see her more often, and promised to spare
no pains to teach them her own method. Is not that
a rare piece of politeness? Indeed, I believe it was
exquisite coquetry which made on me the impression
of <i>naïveté</i>; for one can scarcely imagine anyone
being so natural unless acquainted with all the arts of
coquetry.</p>

<p>M<sup>lle</sup>. Sonntag is a hundred times prettier and nicer <i>en
deshabille</i> than in evening dress, but those who have only
seen her in the concert room are charmed with her beautiful
appearance. On her return she will give concerts
until the 22nd instant, when, she tells me, she thinks of
going to St. Petersburg. So make haste, dear friend,
and come at once that you may not miss any more
concerts.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of talk about Pasta coming, and
of both the artists singing together. A French lady
pianist, M<sup>lle</sup>. Belleville, is here, and intending to give
a concert next Wednesday; her playing is very good,
very light and elegant, ten times better than Worlitzerʼs.
She took part in the famous “soirée musicale” at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">360</a></span>Court, when Sonntag sang and Worlitzer played, though
without giving much satisfaction, as I heard from
Kurpinski, who accompanied the great vocalist. A good
many people were surprised (<i>not</i> including myself) that
I was not invited to play.... But some more
about M<sup>lle.</sup> Sonntag. There is a great deal of new
<i>broderie</i> in her execution, which is very effective, but not
so much so as Paganiniʼs; perhaps because it is of a
smaller kind. She seems to bring with her the perfume
of a fresh bouquet, and to caress and play with her
voice, but she rarely moves one to tears. Radziwill,
however, thinks that her impersonation of Desdemona,
in the last scene of “Otello,” is such that no one could
refrain from weeping.</p>

<p>I asked her, early this morning, if she would not give
us this scene in costume (for she is a capital actress);
she replied that although she could move an audience
to tears, yet acting affected her so painfully that she
had determined to appear on the stage as seldom as
possible.</p>

<p>Come here to rest yourself from your rural cares;
when you hear M<sup>lle.</sup> Sonntag sing you will wake up to
new life and gather fresh strength for your work. What
a pity I cannot send myself instead of this letter....
M<sup>lle.</sup> Belleville has played my Variations, published in
Vienna; she knows one of them by heart. To-day M<sup>lle.</sup>
Sonntag will sing something from “Semiramis.” Her
concerts are short, she sings at the utmost four times,
the orchestra playing between. Indeed one needs to rest
after her singing, so powerful an impression does it
produce and so interesting is she as an artist.</p>

<p class="center">V.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, (I think) September 4th, 1830.</i></p>

<p>My ideas are growing more and more confused. I
am here still, and cannot make up my mind to fix
definitively a day for my departure. It seems to me as
if I were leaving Warsaw for ever; I have a presentiment
that I am bidding an eternal farewell to my home.
Oh, how hard it must be to die anywhere but in oneʼs
birth-place. How could I bear to see around my deathbed,
instead of the faces of my beloved family, an unconcerned
doctor and a hired servant. Believe me, dear
Titus, I often long to come to you to ease my heavy
heart, but as I cannot do that I rush out of doors
without knowing why. But that does not calm or satisfy
my restless, yearning spirit, and I go home only to sigh
again....</p>

<p>I have not yet tried my Concerto. At any rate I shall
have left my treasure behind me before Michaelmas.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a>
In Vienna I shall be condemned to eternal sighs and
languishing. This is so when oneʼs heart is no longer
free. You know very well what that is, but can you
account for that peculiar feeling which makes people
always expect something better from the morrow?
“Do not be so foolish,” is all the answer I can give
myself; if you know a better one, pray, pray tell it me....</p>

<p>These are my plans for the winter: I think of staying
two months in Vienna; then going to Italy and perhaps
spending the winter in Milan. Soliva always conducts
the operas in which his pupils appear; in time, I think,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>he will unseat Kurpinski; he has one foot in the stirrup
already, and is supported by a doughty cavalier.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p>I finish my letter to-day with nothing, indeed with less
than nothing, that is with what I have already said
before. It is half-past eleven, and I am still sitting here
<i>en deshabille</i>, although Mariolka will certainly be already
waiting to go with me to dinner at C.ʼs. I have promised
to visit Magnuszewski afterwards, so I shall not be back
before four oʼclock to finish the page, and the sight
of the blank paper annoys me.</p>

<p>But I will not worry myself unnecessarily, or I shall
never come to an end, and Mariolka will be disappointed
altogether; and, as you know, I like to make myself
agreeable to people of whose good-will I am assured. I
have not been to see her since my return, and I must
confess that I often blame her as the cause of my
dejection; other people seem to be of the same opinion,
and this gives me at last some slight satisfaction. My
father smiles, but if he knew all I think he would weep.
I seem quite happy, but my heart....</p>

<p>By this day month you will have no more letters from
Warsaw, nor perhaps from anywhere else; perhaps you
will not hear from me again before we meet. I am
writing nothing but nonsense now; only the thought
of leaving Warsaw....</p>

<p>But wait awhile, and perhaps you will yourself be
no better off. Man is never always happy, and very
often only a brief period of happiness is granted him in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>this world; so why escape from this dream which cannot
last long?</p>

<p>If I sometimes regard intercourse with the world as a
sacred duty, at other times, I consider it a devilish invention,
and that it would be better if mankind ... but
enough.... Time flies, and I must wash ...
donʼt kiss me yet ... but you would not kiss me
even if I were anointed with Byzantian oil, unless by
some magnetism I forced you to. Farewell.</p>

<hr />
<p class="center">VI.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, September 18th, 1830.</i></p>

<p>I donʼt know exactly why I am still here, but I am
very happy, and my parents agree to my remaining.
Last Wednesday, I tried my concerto with quartet accompaniment,
but was not quite satisfied with it. Those
who were present at the rehearsal say that the <i>finale</i> is
the most successful movement&mdash;perhaps because it is
the most easily understandable. I shall not be able to
tell you till next week how it will sound with the full
orchestra, as I am not going to try it until Wednesday.
To-morrow I am going to have another rehearsal with
the quartet accompaniment, and then I shall go&mdash;whither?
I have no special attraction anywhere, but
at any rate I shall not stay in Warsaw. If you imagine
that some beloved object keeps me here you are wrong,
like a good many other people. I can assure you that as
far as I am concerned, I am ready for any sacrifice. I
love, but I must keep my unhappy passion locked in my
own breast for some years longer. I do not want to
start with you, for the sake of the pleasure of meeting;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>the moment when we embrace for the first time on a
foreign soil will be more precious to me than a thousand
days of travelling together.</p>

<p>I intended to write a polonaise with orchestral accompaniment;
but have only sketched it out in my head;
when it will see the light I cannot say. The <i>Wiener
Zeitung</i> contains a good critique on my variations, short
but comprehensive, and so philosophical that it is almost
impossible to translate. The writer concludes by saying
that the work has not only an external beauty, but an
intrinsic excellence, which will defy the changes of
fashion and make it last for ever. That is indeed a
handsome compliment, for which I shall thank the reviewer
when I see him. I am very pleased with the
article, because, while it is not at all exaggerated, it
acknowledges my independence. I should not say so
much to any one but you, but we understand each other
so well, that I may venture, like the merchants, to
praise my own wares.</p>

<p>Orlowskiʼs new ballet is to be given to-day for the first
time. There is more talk about the astounding nature of
the spectacle than the originality of the music. I was at
great big C.ʼs yesterday, for his name-day, when I played
in Spohrʼs Quintet for piano, clarionet, bassoon, French
horn, and flute.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> The work is wonderfully beautiful,
but the pianoforte part not very playable. Everything
that Spohr wrote for the piano is very difficult, and for
many of his passages one cannot find any fingering at
all. Instead of commencing at 7 oʼclock, we did not
begin playing until eleven. You are, doubtless, surprised
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>that I was not fast asleep. But there was a very good
reason why I should not be, for among the guests was a
beautiful girl, who vividly reminded me of my ideal.
Just fancy, I stayed till 3 a.m.</p>

<p>I was to have started for Vienna by the Cracow
diligence this day week, but finally gave up the idea,&mdash;you
can guess why. You may rest assured that I am
no egoist, and as truly as I love you, would make
any sacrifice for other people. For other people,
I say, but not for outside appearance; for public
opinion, which has great weight here, although I am not
much influenced by it, regards it as a misfortune for a
man to have a shabby coat, or a rubbed hat. If I do not
succeed in my profession, and wake up some fine morning
to find that I have nothing to eat, you must get a
clerkship for me at Poturzyn.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> I shall be as happy in
a stable as I was in your castle last summer. As long
as I have health and strength I will gladly work all my
days. I have often thought it over whether I was really
lazy, or whether I could do more without physical injury.
Joking apart, I am quite sure that I am not very lazy
yet, and that, if necessary, I could do double what I do.</p>

<p>People often lose the good opinion of others by trying
to gain it; but I do not think that I shall either raise or
lower myself in your estimation, although I do sing my
own praises, for there is mutual sympathy between us.
You are not master of your thoughts, but I can command
mine, and when I get an idea into my head, I will
not part with it, anymore than the trees will allow themselves
to be robbed of the green covering which is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>charm and beauty of their life. I, too, keep green in
winter, though only in the head, my heart is red-hot, so
it is no wonder the vegetation is so luxuriant. May God
help me? Enough.... Yours for ever.... I have
just discovered what nonsense I have been talking. You
see I have not got over the effects of yesterday, have not
had my sleep out, and am still tired with having danced
four mazurkas! Your letters are tied up with a ribbon
given me by my ideal. I am very glad that two inanimate
things agree together so well; it is probably because,
although they do not know each other, they both feel
that they come from hands dear to me.</p>

<hr />
<p class="center">VII.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Warsaw, September 22nd, 1830.</i></p>

<p>I must first explain how it is I am still here. For
a fortnight past my father has objected to my going
on account of the disturbances throughout Germany;
in the Rhine provinces, Darmstadt, Brunswick, Capel,
and Saxony, where the new king has already ascended
the throne. It is reported here that there are riots
in Vienna about the meal business; I donʼt know
what it is they want, but it is certain they are fighting
over it. There are agitations also in the Tyrol, while in
Italy they are ready to boil over, and we expect to hear
something important every minute. I have not yet
inquired about a pass, but it is thought that I shall only
get one for Austria or Prussia; Italy and France are
not to be thought of, and I know that some, and often
all, passports have been refused. I shall probably go to
Vienna in a few weeks, <i>viâ</i> Cracow, for I am remembered
there, and one must strike while the iron is hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<p>P. was with me yesterday; he starts early to-morrow,
and as I am going to have a rehearsal of my second
Concerto to-day, with full orchestra (except trumpets
and kettledrums), I have invited him to it, for your sake.
He will be able to tell you all about it, and I know that
the smallest particulars will interest you. I am very
sorry that you are not here; Kurpinski, Soliva, and the
<i>élite</i> of the musical world will be present, but, with the
exception of course of Elsner, I have not much confidence
in their judgment. I am most curious to know
what the band-master will think of the Italian; Czapek
of Kessler; Philippeus of Dobrzynski; Molsdorf of
Kaczynski; Ledoux of Soltyk; and Mons. P. of us all.
No one has ever assembled all these gentlemen in one
place before; I do it out of curiosity.</p>

<p>I am very sorry I have to write on a day like this
when I cannot compose myself. It almost drives me
out of my mind to think about myself, and I often go
about so buried in thought as to be in danger of being
run over, which, indeed, nearly happened yesterday.
Catching a glimpse of my ideal in church, I rushed
out in a state of happy stupefaction, and it was nearly a
quarter of an hour before I came to myself again. I am
quite frightened sometimes at my own distraction. I
should like to send you a few trifles I have just composed,
but donʼt know whether I shall manage to write
them out to-day.</p>

<p>I beg you to excuse this hasty letter, but I must hasten
off to Elsner to make sure of his presence at the rehearsal.
Then I must see about the desks, and the
<i>sordini</i>, which I quite forgot yesterday, but without
which the <i>adagio</i> would be nothing. The <i>rondo</i> is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>effective, and the first <i>allegro</i> powerful. Confounded
self-love! But if anyone is responsible for my share
of it, it is you. You egoist, who could live with a
person like you without growing like you? However,
in one respect I am still unlike: I can never make a
rapid resolution. Still, I have relentlessly determined
on departing next Saturday week, in spite of any amount
of weeping and lamentation. The music in the trunk,
the familiar ribbon on my heart, a mind full of care, and
I am off in the post carriage. Of course the city will
flow with tears from Copernicus to the fountain, and
from the bank to King Sigismundʼs column; but I shall
be as cold and insensible as a stone, and laugh at all the
people who want to take such a tender adieu of me....</p>

<p class="center">VIII.</p>

<p class="right"><i>Paris, December 25th, 1831.</i></p>

<p>For the second time, my dear Titus, I have to send
my birth-day congratulations from a long, long distance.
A look, a pressure of the hand would say more than a
dozen letters, so I will not waste many words. I cannot
write <i>ex abrupto</i>, and I have not yet bought one of the
books of congratulations which the boys are shrieking
about the streets at two sous a copy. The Parisians are a
strange people; towards evening you hear nothing but the
names of new books, which consist of three or four pages
of printed nonsense. The youngsters push their wares so
well, that in the end, whether you will or no, you are sure
to lay out a sou or two. The following are some specimens
of the titles, “lʼart de faire des amours et de les conserver
ensuite;” “les amours des prêtres;” “lʼArcheveque
de Paris avec Madame la duchesse de Berry,” and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>hundreds of like absurdities, which are, however, often
very wittily written. It is really astonishing what means
are resorted to for earning a penny, for there is a great
deal of distress in Paris just now, and money is scarce.
There are a good many shabby, desperate looking men
about, and one over-hears some threatening talk about
Louis Philippe and his ministry only hanging by a hair.
The populace are enraged against the Government, and
would like to overthrow it, for the sake of putting an end
to the misery abroad; but the latter are too much on
their guard, and the smallest crowd is dispersed by the
mounted gendarmerie. You must know that I am
living on the fourth floor, but in one of the boulevards in
the best part of Paris. I have a balcony over-looking
the street, and so have a good view right and left over
the moving masses. General Ramorino has taken up
his quarters exactly opposite in the Cité bergère.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>You know, of course, how the Germans everywhere
received him, how in Strasburg the French dragged his
carriage in triumph through the streets; in short, you
know all about the enthusiasm of the populace for our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>general. Paris did not wish to be behind in this respect.
The “école de médecine” and the “jeune France,” who
wear beards and neckties after a certain pattern, arranged
for a grand demonstration. The ultra sections of every
political party have their peculiar badge: the Carlists
wear green waistcoats; the Republicans, Napoleonists,
(these include “la jeune France”) and the Simonists,
who profess a new religion, and have already a great
number of proselytes, wear blue, and so forth. Nearly a
thousand of these enthusiasts paraded the streets with
a tri-color banner to give Ramorino an ovation. Although
he was at home he would not appear in spite of the
shouts of “vive les Polonais,” for fear of offending the
government. His adjutant came out and said that the
general was unfortunately unable to receive them, and
begged that they would come another day. But next
morning he had gone to another lodging. A few days
later an enormous mob gathered outside the Pantheon,
marched across the Seine towards Ramorinoʼs house,
like an avalanche, increasing in force as they proceeded,
till they reached the Pont neuf where the mounted
gendarmes, after several charges, dispersed them.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>Although many were wounded a fresh crowd assembled
on the boulevards under my windows, for the purpose of
joining those who came from the other side of the Seine.
The police were powerless, the crowd grew larger and
larger, until a division of infantry and a squadron of
hussars arrived, when the commandant ordered the
municipal guard and the troops to clear the streets and
arrest the ringleaders. (This is their free nation!)</p>

<p>The panic spread like lightning: the shops were
closed, crowds congregated at the corners, and the
orderlies were hissed as they galloped about the streets.
Every window was crammed with spectators, as on
grand fête-days with us, and the uproar lasted from
11 a.m. till 11 p.m. I thought once some mischief
might have followed, but about midnight they struck
up “allons, enfants de la patrie,” and went home. I
cannot describe to you the effect of the harsh voices
of this excited and discontented mob. Everyone feared
the <i>émeute</i> would begin again next morning, but it
did not. Grenoble alone followed the example of Lyons,
but the devil knows what will come of it.</p>

<p>At a theatre, where only dramas have hitherto been
performed, the whole history of our late revolution
is being given, and people go like mad to see the
fights and the national costumes. Mlle. Plater and
some other ladies take the names of Lodoiska, Faniska,
and Floreska, and a General Gigult appears as brother
to Countess Plater.<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> But nothing amazed me so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>as the announcement on the play bill of a small theatre
that the mazurka “Dabrowski, Poland is not lost yet,”
would be performed during the entrʼactes.</p>

<p>All I can tell you about my concert is that I must
postpone it until January 15th, as the operatic director,
Mons. Véron, refuses to let me have a vocalist. There
is to be a grand concert to-day at the Italian opera
house, in which Malibran, Rubini, Lablache, Santini,
Madame Raimbaux, Madame Schröder, and Madame
Casadory are to appear; Herz and Bériot, with whom
Madame Malibran is in love, will assist in the instrumental
portion.</p>

<p>Oh, how I wish you were with me.... You cannot
think how wretched it makes me to have no one to
whom I can unbosom myself. You know how fond
I am of society, and how easily I make acquaintances.
I have scores of such friends now, but no one with
whom I can sigh. My heart is, so to speak, always
beating in “syncopation,” which torments me, and
makes me seek for a pause, for solitude, so that no one
could see me or speak to me all day. It is most
disagreeable that while I am writing to you, the bell
rings and some tedious visitor is announced. Just as I
was going to describe to you a ball, at which I met
a divine creature with a rose in her dark hair, your
letter arrived. All the creations of my fancy disappeared;
my thoughts fly to you, I take your hand and
weep.... When shall we meet again?... Perhaps
never, for in all seriousness my health is miserable.
I seem merry enough perhaps, especially when among
friends, but there is something constantly troubling
me within: melancholy forebodings, restlessness, bad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>dreams, sleeplessness, yearning, no pleasure in life,
and indifference to death. It often seems to me as
if a torpor came over my spirits; a heavenly calm
descends on my head, and images I cannot get rid
of haunt my imagination, and harass me beyond
measure. In short, it is a mixture of feelings not easily
described.... Forgive me, dear Titus, for pouring
it all out to you, but this is enough.... Now I will go
and dress for the dinner that our countrymen are giving
to-day to Ramorino and Langermann.... Your letter
gave me a great deal of news; you wrote four sides
and thirty-seven lines; you have never been so generous
before, and I really was so much in need of something
when your letter came.</p>

<p>What you say about my artistic career is very true,
and I am quite convinced of it myself. I drive in my
own carriage, but the coachman is hired. I conclude,
or I shall be too late for the post, for I am all in one,
master and servant. Take pity on me, and write as
often as possible.</p>

<p class="right padr3">Yours till death,</p>
<p class="right">FREDERIC.</p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> Maximilian Stadler, born at Molk, in Lower Austria,
August 4th, 1748, was an excellent pianist and organist. His
ecclesiastical compositions were extremely popular in Vienna.
In the last years of his life he was much occupied in writing on
art, history, and science. He died universally esteemed and
beloved in Vienna, November 8th, 1833.</p></div>

violoncellist at the Grand Opera in Paris, and teacher at the
Conservatoire. He died 1852.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> Aloys Fuchs, born 1799 in Austrio-Silesia, was for some
time musical historiographer and antiquarian at the Austrian
Royal Chapel. He possessed a great many autographs and
portraits; and scores of the masters of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries; also Mozartʼs compositions, in his own
handwriting. Fuchs played the violoncello very well, and was
one of Beethovenʼs intimate friends. At the sale of Beethovenʼs
property, Fuchs bought, among other manuscripts, one of the
sketch books, which he sent, as a mark of respect, to Mendelssohn.
Another of these books was bought by Meyerbeerʼs
brother, William Beer. Fuchsʼs fine collection was dispersed
at his death, in 1852.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10" id="Footnote_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> Alexander Count Von Fredro, born 1793, celebrated as a
writer of excellent comedies, and called by his countrymen,
the Polish Molière, began his literary labours with a translation
of Goetheʼs “Clavigo.” His comedies sparkle with
original ideas, and are an ornament to the national stage.
He died at Lemberg, July 14th, 1876.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_11" id="Footnote_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> The Pleyel piano sent from Scotland in 1858, was fortunately
in the possession of Chopinʼs niece, Madame Ciechomska, who
lived in the country.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12" id="Footnote_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> There is a notice of this concert, probably by Kandler, in
No. 38 of the <i>Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung</i> for September
21st, 1831. It says, “Frederic Chopin, whose visit, last year,
showed him to be a pianist of the first rank, has given a
concert here. The performance of his new Concerto, which is
of an earnest character, gave us no occasion to alter our first
opinion. So sincere a worshipper of true art is worthy of all
honour.” Other Vienna journals spoke in the same manner of
his compositions, and praised his skilful and expressive playing;
but these acknowledgments did not satisfy the hopes and
wishes of the young artist.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Leipsic was foremost in this. Many German poets also
expressed their sympathy with the oppressed Polish nation
in spirited songs.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Lokietek and Laskonogi were Kings of Poland, and so
called, the former on account of his small size, the latter
because he had spindle legs. Elsner wrote an opera, in 1818,
entitled “Lokietek,” which was very successful.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> This friend says that the later letters, from Paris, are all

of Chopinʼs death, the last he wrote to Woyciechowski.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> The author says, in a note, that he does not know to what
critique or to which Mazurkas Elsner refers. There are eight
sets of these “cabinet pictures,” as Liszt calls them, and, as
one of Chopinʼs most enthusiastic critics remarks, they vividly
portray his patriotic and home feelings. He calls them green
spots in the desert, quaint snatches of melancholy song, outpourings
of an unworldly and trustful soul, musical floods of
tears and gushes of pure joyfulness.&mdash;<i>Translatorʼs Note.</i></p></div>

in addition to many scientific articles in home and foreign
journals, “Dernier Mot sur le pouvoir social” (Paris, 1836),
“Code civil de lʼempire de Russie” (Paris, 1841), “Précis des
notions historiques sur la formation du corps des lois russes”
(Petersbourg, 1843.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_40" id="Footnote_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> From December, 1840, till March, 1844, Mickiewicz
lectured at the Collège de France, on Slavic literature. His
wide-spread fame and his ability as a lecturer attracted
crowded audiences. But he sank into a morbid mysticism,
and talked of a visionary millennium instead of literature, and
was, on that account, suspended by the authorities. His
lectures are published under the title of “Les slaves. Cours
professé au Collège de France.” (Paris, 1849.)</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_42" id="Footnote_42"></a><a href="#FNanchor_42"><span class="label">[42]</span></a> It cannot be said that Chopin obtruded himself on the
public notice; for, from 1834 to 1848, he only gave one public
concert (Feb. 21st, 1842) with the assistance of Viardot-Garcia
and Franchomme, when Chopin performed the following compositions:
Ballade (A flat major); three mazurkas (A flat, B,
A minor); three studies (A flat, F minor, C minor); prelude
(D flat); impromptu (G flat); nocturne (D flat.) As this
concert naturally made a much better impression than the
first given in the Italian theatre, on account of Chopinʼs
poetical and expressive playing, he held <i>séances</i> in the Pleyel
Hall nearly every year, when he always played alone, and his
admirers and friends paid twenty francs for their tickets.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_43" id="Footnote_43"></a><a href="#FNanchor_43"><span class="label">[43]</span></a> Chopinʼs last concert began with one of Mozartʼs trios, in
which Alard and Franchomme took part. Then Chopin played
his new ʼcello-sonata in G minor (op. 65), and some smaller
pieces&mdash;studies, preludes, mazurkas, and waltzes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_44" id="Footnote_44"></a><a href="#FNanchor_44"><span class="label">[44]</span></a> Chopin always wanted flowers about him, and, if possible,
violets.</p></div>

was born in Genoa, 1792; he left his country for political
reasons, and entered the French army, to take part in the war
against Austria and Russia. During the Restoration he lived
in Savoy. When the revolution broke out in Piedmont in
1821, he bravely and successfully commanded the insurgent
forces. When the disturbances were over he went to France,
and in 1830, to Warsaw, when he became colonel in the
Polish army. He distinguished himself in several battles and
soon obtained the rank of General. At the end of August,
1831, he was ordered to lead 20,000 men against the Russian
general, Rosen, on the right bank of the Vistula, and to victual
Warsaw. But he failed shamefully. He might easily have
beaten Rosen and relieved Warsaw; but, owing to his carelessness,
and neglect of the Commander-in-chiefʼs orders, he did
not reach the besieged city in time. Instead, therefore, of an
ovation he deserved the utmost contempt and reprobation, as
the main cause of the miseries which from that time fell thick
and fast upon Poland. But Nemesis at length overtook him.
In the beginning of 1849, he entered the Sardinian army, and
took the command of the fifth (Lombard) division; but he once
more disobeyed orders, and opened the way for the Austrians
into Piedmont. He was imprisoned, tried by court-martial,
and shot at Piazza dʼArmi, near Turin, May 22nd, 1849.</p></div>

during the revolution of 1831, served as a soldier, assumed

Her biography has been fully written by Straszewicz.</p></div>
